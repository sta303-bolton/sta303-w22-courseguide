\subsection{Course description}\label{course-description}}

The course focuses on using and interpreting advanced statistical methods with applications in a number of different areas. The overall theme of this course is dealing with situations where the assumptions of the regression models developed in STA302 may not apply. The course is a mixture of theory and application. Assignments will involve computing with R and there is a significant focus on written and oral communication.

\hypertarget{land-acknowledgment}{%
\section{Land acknowledgment}\label{land-acknowledgment}}

The land on which our University operates is the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. With the Dish With One Spoon treaty, these peoples agreed to share and protect this land, and all those who have come here since, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, are invited into this treaty in a spirit of respect and peace. This land is also, more recently, subject to Treaty 13, a treaty between the Mississaugas and the British Crown.

In this course, we are coming together to discuss statistics, a field that has been part of historical and ongoing colonization, oppression, and harm of Indigenous peoples. Let us remind ourselves of our responsibilities to this land, its original peoples, and to each other and work to be ethical and culturally competent practitioners in our chosen fields.

We encourage you to consider the history of the land wherever you are. \url{https://www.whose.land/en/}

\hypertarget{prerequisites}{%
\section{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

STA302/1001

I.e., we will assume that you are familiar with running linear regression analyses, including checking assumptions and some of the mathematical reasoning behind the models. Material from the second-year statistical theory courses which are prerequisites to STA302 will be drawn on extensively. Knowledge of programming with R is essential.

\hypertarget{course-format-and-organization}{%
\section{Course format and organization}\label{course-format-and-organization}}

This course is composed of \textbf{five two-week modules} and \textbf{two assessment focus weeks.}

Each \textbf{module} has an ``I show you, you show me'' structure. It starts with you watching videos and/or doing readings and a guided code demonstration or other relevant class topics (``I show you''). This course is flipped, so the expectation is that you engage with some or all of the asynchronous content before Wednesday in the first week. Then you will do some or all of the following: a group problem-solving activity, practice quizzes, assessment activities.

During \textbf{assessment focus weeks}, no new content will be released.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section{Learning objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Wrangle} and \textbf{explore} a dataset
\item
  Create appropriate data \textbf{visualizations}
\item
  Describe \textbf{ethical} \textbf{considerations} in data analysis
\item
  Understand the assumptions and appropriate use cases for \textbf{linear mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models,} and \textbf{generalized additive models}
\item
  \textbf{Write} and \textbf{execute R code} for the model types covered
\item
  Accurately and appropriately \textbf{interpret} the results of the model types covered and communicate these to a range of \textbf{audiences}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{textbooks}{%
\section{Textbooks}\label{textbooks}}

You do not have to purchase a textbook for this course. There are three texts that we will use extensively, and they are all freely available to you. Additional readings will be assigned as appropriate.

\hypertarget{assessments}{%
\section{Assessments}\label{assessments}}

There are two special elements of assessment/grade calculation in this course that are important to be aware of in planning your approach to it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Two roads diverged in a yellow wood}\footnote{The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost. But, dear traveller, you can in fact take both roads and then get whichever gives you the better mark. \url{https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken}}\emph{:} You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark. I will calculate your marks along both paths and then assign you the higher of the two as your final mark. (Grad students have a third option)
\item
  A-tisket, a-tasket\footnote{A-tisket, a-tasket by Ella Fitzgerald, \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgFkeDLpSI}}, fill up your \textbf{knowledge basket}\footnote{``Whaowhia te kete mātauranga'' is a Māori proverb meaning ``Fill up the basket of knowledge''. Mātauranga is specifically traditional Māori knowledge. You can listen to the pronunciation here \url{https://www.massey.ac.nz/student-life/m\%C4\%81ori-at-massey/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-and-tikanga-resources/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-pronunciation-and-translations/whakatauk\%C4\%AB-m\%C4\%81ori-proverbs/}}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Personalize which of these assessments you do based on your interests and skills you want to develop.
  \item
    You can `max out' your basket: just keep putting grades in until you get to 10\% (Path A) or 5\% (Path B).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Everything \footnote{Mixed assessment windows are 8-8, I couldn't make the 303 work out fairly.} in STA303 is due at 3:03 p.m. ET

Note: All times in this course are in Eastern Time (Toronto time). Please note that daylight savings will begin in Canada on March 13. If you are not based in Canada this may change the time conversion for you. Please keep this in mind.

\hypertarget{hours-expectations}{%
\section{Hours expectations}\label{hours-expectations}}

While everyone has different work styles and learning needs, I want to provide some guidance around how I expect this course to look for you.

Plan to be doing 6--8 hours of work on STA303 each week. In a \textbf{two-week module}, this may look like:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  2--4 hours on videos and readings
\item
  1--3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities
\item
  1--2 hours on knowledge basket assessments
\item
  2--6 hours on other assessments
\item
  Remaining time attending reading announcements, office hours, checking Piazza, revision, etc.
\end{itemize}

At the University of Toronto, we are part of a diverse community of students, staff, and faculty from a wide range of cultural and religious traditions. For this course, I have sought to avoid scheduling compulsory activities in ways that will clash with religious holy days (not captured by statutory holidays). If you anticipate missing a course activity due to a religious observance, please let me know as early in the course as possible. With sufficient notice---ideally at least three weeks---we can work together to make alternate arrangements.

You may be at risk of plagiarizing if you do not understand the rules and your responsibilities. You must not present the work of others as your own. This includes, but is certainly not limited to, copying text and including it in your writing without a citation and quotation marks.

There are many resources to help you learn more:

YOU are responsible for knowing the content of the \href{http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm}{University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters}. The University of Toronto treats cases of academic misconduct very seriously. Academic integrity is a fundamental value of learning and scholarship at the U of T.

Other potential offences include, but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Looking at someone else's answers.
\item
  Letting someone else look at your answers.
\item
  Misrepresenting your identity.
\item
  Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University.

\hypertarget{specific-advice-on-untimed-assessments}{%
\subsection{Specific advice on untimed assessments}\label{specific-advice-on-untimed-assessments}}

As a general rule, for untimed assessments, I encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice. However, it is \textbf{not permitted} to share R code or written answers for anything that is to be handed in. For example, ``For question 2 what R function did you use?'' is a fair question when discussing course material with others in the class; ``Please show me your R code for question 2'' is not an appropriate question.

If writing or code is discovered to match another student's submission or outside source, this will be reported as an academic offense. \textbf{When asked to hand in code and the output it creates, the code you submit must have been used to generate the document.} If it does not (i.e., the submitted code does not match the submitted output), this is also considered an academic offense.

\hypertarget{rules-for-timed-assessments-e.g.-mixed-assessments}{%
\subsection{Rules for timed assessments (e.g., mixed assessments)}\label{rules-for-timed-assessments-e.g.-mixed-assessments}}

While all timed assessments in this course are open-book, they are not ``open-person''. You MUST NOT discuss any details of the assessment with anyone else during the assessment window, regardless of your completion status. This includes, but is not limited to, current classmates, friends, and tutors. For example, even asking someone ``which slide did you look at to answer question 3'' is not appropriate for timed assessments.

\hypertarget{note-be-careful-about-private-tutoring-companies}{%
\subsection{NOTE: BE CAREFUL ABOUT PRIVATE TUTORING COMPANIES}\label{note-be-careful-about-private-tutoring-companies}}

You may have been contacted by private tutoring companies trying to sell their services to you for statistics courses. Please be extremely careful with these services as some forms of tutoring can pose an academic offence risk. A good tutor helps you understand the subject area and supports your learning. A good tutor does not give you answers. \textbf{There are no shortcuts to learning. Learning takes time and effort.}

Be cautious about giving money to companies whose motivation is profit. They may tell you they have `insider information'. They don't. They may even offer you the opportunity to commit academic offenses. Please do not put your University of Toronto education at risk by participating in these kinds of unacceptable behaviours. If you have any questions or concerns about what is okay and what is not in your course, please ask!

I know some students absolutely hate weekly tasks and how common they have become with online learning, and that all the little tasks and deadlines can become overwhelming. I also know that cramming is the absolute worst way to learn and actually retain that learning.

This is why in this course:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I have taken things out or made them baskets options, based on student feedback
\item
  There is a knowledge basket that lets you approach frequent low-stakes practice in the way that suits you best and aims to facilitate and reward spaced repetition, the way science says is the best way to learn (\href{http://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn}{this free course is fantastic for learning more about how to learn}).

If there is something I could do differently in this area that would make your life easier and you're comfortable to tell me, please do! One thing I know isn't great but, regretfully, don't have the resources to change, is the `quality assurance' of the autogenerated captions for videos.

Before moving (back) to Canada in 2019, I had lived more than half my life in New Zealand. (I still mention New Zealand a lot in class\ldots) My current research areas are in statistics education and online learning, as well as health disparities across ethnic groups. I used to run a small consulting company and called myself a Data Ambassador. Why? Well, lots of people are consultants. I even did an internship in management consulting once upon a time. But it wasn't a satisfying title for what I wanted my work with people to look like. I wanted something that focused on the communication and interpersonal side, not just high quality and appropriate analysis. People who aren't confident in their ability to analyse their own data need a go-between, someone who can be an ambassador for their data! While I don't do consulting any more, I love helping students build their technical and professional skills so they can go out into the world and be excellent ambassadors for data themselves.

But, dear traveller, you can in fact take both roads and then get whichever gives you the better mark. \url{https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken}}\emph{:} You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark.

There is no difference in the grading scheme or assessment for graduate students enrolled in STA1002, other than an additional `path' to your final grade where you may opt out of the `basket' assessments, if you wish. This only applies to graduate students enrolled in STA1002, not to any students enrolled in STA303.

You don't need to advise me of your choice, I will calculate you mark all three ways above and give you the highest of those marks.

The module writing and peer feedback activities have three stages.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Create} phase due the first Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET
\item
  \textbf{Assess} phase due the second Tuesday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET
\item
  \textbf{Reflect} phase due the second Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{create-phase}{%
\subsection{Create phase}\label{create-phase}}

The \textbf{Create} phase is due the first Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Spend \textasciitilde30 minutes writing a response to the prompt.
\item
  Write about 200--500 words. The word count isn't strict, but the submission requirements listed below ARE.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The prompt should be clearly and comprehensively addressed.
  \item
    Your writing should be in full sentences and be broken into paragraphs as appropriate.
  \item
    Any grammatical or word choice errors should be minimal and not obstruct the meaning.
  \item
    There is a clear central idea that is well summarized in a concluding sentence(s).
  \end{itemize}

  \hypertarget{submission-requirements}{%
  \subsubsection{Submission requirements}\label{submission-requirements}}

  Your submission should be:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    typed (not handwritten)
  \item
    no more than one page
  \item
    single-spaced
  \item
    size 12 font
  \item
    margins should be no larger than 1 inch
  \item
    saved as a PDF
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assess-phase}{%
\subsection{Assess phase}\label{assess-phase}}

The \textbf{Assess} phase is due the second Tuesday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

You will need to assess TWO of your peers in this phase. You will be asked:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  if they have met the submission requirements,
\item
  to rate them on the rubric,
\item
  to make a short comment about a strength of this piece of writing,
\item
  to make a short comment about a way this piece of writing could be improved.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{reflect-phase}{%
\subsection{Reflect phase}\label{reflect-phase}}

The \textbf{Reflect} phase is due second Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Read the feedback received from your peers.
\item
  Rate the usefulness on a 3-point scale.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{general-instructions}{%
\subsection{General instructions}\label{general-instructions}}

These assessments can be used to make up your knowledge basket. They are also useful in helping you prepare for your portfolio writing samples and final project writing.

Warning: MAKE SURE YOU CLICK SUBMIT! Check that each phase is showing as submitted. Students have occasionally struggled with this in peerScholar's interface and no regrades/adjustments will be possible after the fact.

Your mark for this assessment will be based on participation. There will be separate marks for each phase, i.e., you can get part marks overall. 45\% for completing create, 45\% for completing assess, 10\% for completing reflect. Please note that participation not in the spirit of the assessment (e.g.~just putting the Lorem Ipsum text, or giving feedback like ``write better'' and nothing else) will not get you marks.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/assessments/tree-sounds} \end{center}

Image source: \url{https://www.nsta.org/q-if-tree-falls-forest-and-theres-no-one-around-hear-it-does-it-make-sound}

If a tree falls in a forest, and there's no one around to hear it, does it make a sound? Or, more relevant to this course, if you do a data analysis and can't share it with anyone in helpful ways, did you\emph{really} do anything? With this in mind, you will have the opportunity to choose an area of relevant professional development to pursue over the course of the semester. This could include technical skills that make you better at collaborating with others (version control, Git, GitHub), creating things others will find useful (an R package) or practising communication (oral or written).

There is a 1\% \textbf{proposal} due fairly early in the semester, and then the final submission of \textbf{evidence} of, and \textbf{reflection} on, your activity is worth 3\% and due toward the end of the semster.

Example professional development tasks include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Learning how to set up and use Git and GitHub (this might come in handy if collaborating on the final project with a group)
\item
  Setting up a personal profile website (a bit like a digital CV, GitHub provides free hosting for simple sites)
\item
  Participating in weekly TidyTuesday activities
\item
  Writing a stats blog
\item
  Developing an R package and sharing it on GitHub
\item
  A public speaking based activity like a debating society or Toastmasters
\item
  Conducting a series of interviews with industry professional or academics and publishing videos/write-ups
\item
  Create a wildly successful stats memes TikTok à la \href{https://www.tiktok.com/@chelseaparlettpelleriti/video/6811647290709757189?u_code=d894729j1bcal8\&preview_pb=0\&language=en\&timestamp=1585960235\&user_id=6736543492652696582\&utm_campaign=client_share\&app=musically\&utm_medium=ios\&user_id=6736543492652696582\&tt_from=twitter\&utm_source=twitter\&source=h5_m}{Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti} (okay, maybe not this one\ldots but she's well worth checking out)
\end{itemize}

Note: the task must be related to \textbf{communication or collaboration in some way}. For example, `learning SQL' would not be sufficiently directly related to communication or collaboration, but developing an R package and sharing it with others requires communication (writing the documentation) and is a great way to contribute to the collaborative and supportive R community. If you are not sure, please ask!

You will use the SMART goals framework (see image below) when setting out your proposal. The more thought you put into this upfront, the easier collecting evidence and reflecting on your progress will be at the end. More information will be available on the respective assessment pages when they go live.

Note: This is \emph{not} a collaboration/communication goal, but provides some examples of how to approach a SMART goal. Where there are ellipses (``\ldots{}'') we are suggesting there would be more of the same, but this example should be enough to give you the idea. You should \emph{not} use ellipses in this way in your own proposal.

\hypertarget{specific}{%
\subsubsection{Specific}\label{specific}}

Goal: \emph{``Climb to the peak of Mount Robson over 2 weeks in January and write one blog post for my website about the journey.''}

Bad example: ``Climb a mountain and write about it.'' Which mountain? What type of writing and with what purpose?

Resources: \emph{``I will need climbing equipment, my camera, notebook \ldots{}''}

\hypertarget{measurable}{%
\subsubsection{Measurable}\label{measurable}}

Defining success: "\emph{Reach the peak of Mount Robson and return and write at least 1 blog entry with a picture about the journey, all in 2 weeks."}

Bad example: ``Climbed Mount Robson.'' Needs more details about what this success looks like. Walk up a few metres and turn back? Relates to time-bounded also.

Measuring my progress: \emph{``I will measure my progress by how many steps of my goals I have accomplished and the altitude of my climb relative to the elevation of Mount Robson (3,954 m). I will have taken a picture''}

\hypertarget{attainable}{%
\subsubsection{Attainable}\label{attainable}}

You have or can you learn the required skills: \emph{``I am sufficiently fit to make this climb safely and have climbed a similar mountain recently. I have a camera and am currently taking an online course on blogging.''}

Possible steps I need to take:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Arrive at Mount Robson Visitors Center with my climbing plan.}
\item
  \emph{Climb until \ldots{} on first day.}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{\ldots{}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Write one blog entry with one picture.}
\end{enumerate}

Bad example: ``Make progress with my goal by 7\% each day.'' Not useful to you, what does 7\% actually mean here? Will it really be the same amount of progress every day?

Potential problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Weather might be bad, and I may have to delay my climb by a few days.}
\end{enumerate}

Bad example: ``Something might not work.'' What? In what way? Could you solve it?

\hypertarget{relevant}{%
\subsubsection{Relevant}\label{relevant}}

Personal relevance: "\emph{The climbing experience will help me learn new skills like \ldots{} which will help me work towards becoming a professional climbing guide."}

Bad example\emph{: ``Seems like fun.''}

\section{Upward management tips}\label{upward-management-tips}}

`Upward management' is basically managing your manager. \footnote{I used to haaaate this concept because I learned it while doing a consulting internship at a large international professional services firm and I really struggled with my manager.} If you make their life easier and help them be more effective, this should also make \emph{your} life easier and is a good investment in your own career and skills building.

While our course isn't a business, some of the basic parts of this concept apply well to your time at univeristy AND can set you up for success in graduate studies and your future career.

\textbf{But why should you put effort into upward managing me?} Well, while I will always seek to treat all students fairly and to listen to your feedback, YOU can make this easier or harder for me, and thus make this course better or worse for yourselves.

For example, if I have to use all my time and energy following up on unclear emails for more information and dealing with students who haven't followed instructions etc. etc\ldots.I won't have that energy to put into writing TeamUp! activities to give you extra practice and opportunities to earn bonus points.

  Putting in a little effort into find answers before posting on Piazza/asking in class. (\emph{Have you searched Piazza? have you re-read/watched the assigned materials? have your checked the syllabus and recent announcements?})
\item
  Come to office hours often, lists of questions very welcome!

In a linear model,

\(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + ... + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i\)

The response is predicted by a linear function of
explanatory (or predictor) variables plus an error term.

a.k.a.

\textbf{DATA = MODEL + ERROR}

\hypertarget{linear-regression-assumptions}{%
\section{Linear regression assumptions}\label{linear-regression-assumptions}}

\textbf{L}: your model is \textbf{L}inear.

\textbf{I}: Errors are \textbf{I}ndependent (usually satisfied if observations are independent).

\textbf{N}: Errors are \textbf{N}ormally distributed with expected value zero, \(E[\epsilon_i]=0\)

\textbf{E}: \textbf{E}qual/constant variance (homoscedasticity), \(\text{var}[\epsilon_i] = \sigma^2\).

We can express ``I N E'' above as assuming the errors are i.i.d Normal with mean of zero and variance \(\sigma^2\),
\[\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\]

\hypertarget{what-makes-it-a-linear-model}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{What makes it a \emph{linear} model?}{What makes it a linear model?}}\label{what-makes-it-a-linear-model}}

A model is \textbf{linear} if it is \emph{linear in the parameters}. That is, all the \(\beta\) enter the model in a linear way. It is totally fine if the predictor varaibles enter the model in a non-linear way.

  \(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \beta_2x_i^2 + \epsilon_i\)\\

Internally screaming ``DON'T LET THE BETAS TOUCH'' often helps me remember what is not linear. Additionally, don't let them do anything \emph{weird}, like get exponentiated.

\emph{Technical note: I have had to remove code answer checking, but if you get stuck the final `Hint' is the solution. This is ungraded, so don't worry, just slightly inconvenient.}

You have probably encountered several statistical tests in your studies so far.

\hypertarget{parametric}{%
\subsubsection{Parametric}\label{parametric}}

\textbf{E.g. one-sample t-tests, paired t-tests, two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA}\\
Parametric tests make assumptions about the distribution of the population from which our sample data have been drawn.

\hypertarget{non-parametric}{%
\subsubsection{Non-parametric}\label{non-parametric}}

\textbf{E.g. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallace}\\
Non-parametric tests do not assume that our outcome is Normally distributed. They are sometimes called `distribution-free', but note that this is because they have fewer assumptions than parametric tests, not because they have no assumptions at all.

\hypertarget{aside-but-why-are-there-two-types-of-tests}{%
\subsubsection{Aside: But why are there two types of tests?}\label{aside-but-why-are-there-two-types-of-tests}}

Parametric tests are more \textbf{powerful}, i.e., they have a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one there to find. So why would you ever use a less powerful test? Well, with great power comes \sout{great responsibility}, or at least, more assumptions that must be valid to proceed.

There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content. \url{https://tenor.com/view/spider-man-uncle-ben-with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-its-true-just-saying-gif-24193883}

Non-parametric tests are a great choice when your outcome is an ordinal variable, is ranks, or there are problematic outliers.

For the purposes of this lesson, we're going to focus more on parametric tests, but also take a look at the corresponding non-parametric tests with the slight white lie that they are just ranked versions of their parametric companions. This approach is pretty good as long as you have a reasonable sample size.

\emph{Imagine this:}\\
\emph{You're on a ship trying to spot land. \textbf{Parametric} tests are the crew member with the best eyesight, but they can be fussy and the conditions have to be right for them to work in or they will breakdown.}

\emph{\textbf{Non-parametric} tests are the crew member with not quite as good eyesight, but they're more laid back about the conditions you make them work in.}

In the following sections we'll explore several of these tests.

\hypertarget{one-sample-t-test}{%
\subsection{One-sample t-test}\label{one-sample-t-test}}

I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

\hypertarget{use-case}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case}}

You want to know if it is believable that the population mean is a certain value (our `hypothesized value' below).

\hypertarget{assumptions}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed.
\item
  The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\end{enumerate}

(Do these sound familiar from linear regression?)

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

\[H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}\]

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population mean is some hypothesized value.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{hypothesized val}}{s/\sqrt{n}} \]

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom df = n - 1 and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.

\hypertarget{example}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example}}

Suppose existing research suggests that the average weight of penguins is 4000 grams. You want to see if this makes sense for your new penguins data.

\[H_0: \mu = 4000\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne 4000\]

The \texttt{penguins} dataset is already loaded, you you don't have to run any libraries. Use the \texttt{t.test()} function run a one-sample t-test.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  penguins$body_mass_g
## t = 4.6525, df = 341, p-value = 4.7e-06
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 4000
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  4116.458 4287.050
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##  4201.754
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{now-as-a-linear-model}{%
\subsubsection{Now as a linear model}\label{now-as-a-linear-model}}

First, consider the following, what would a linear regression with no predictor variables and just an intercept tell you?

Create a linear regression model called \texttt{mod1}(replace the blank below) that is an `intercept only model' with \texttt{body\_mass\_g} as the response.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ 1, data = penguins)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -1501.8  -651.8  -151.8   548.2  2098.2 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)  4201.75      43.36   96.89   <2e-16 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom
##   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
\end{verbatim}

It turns out the estimate from this linear regression is the same as the sample mean.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4201.754
\end{verbatim}

Now, recall that with the t-test, we calculate our test statistic by subtracting the hypothesized value from the mean. Let's run the linear model again, but on the left-hand side of the formula, subtract the hypothesized value.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = body_mass_g - 4000 ~ 1, data = penguins)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -1501.8  -651.8  -151.8   548.2  2098.2 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)   201.75      43.36   4.652  4.7e-06 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom
##   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
\end{verbatim}

Compare the results of this \texttt{summary(mod2)} and your earlier t-test. You should see that the t value, degrees of freedom and p-value are the same for both analyses.

Thus, our one sample t-test hypotheses,
\[H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}\]

are equivalent to our linear regression hypotheses about the intercept,

\[H_0: \beta_0 = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \beta_0 \ne \text{hypothesized val}.\]

\hypertarget{wilcoxon-signed-rank-test}{%

\hypertarget{dummy-variables}{%

Let's take a quick detour before we explore the next tests. We'll need to understand the concept of dummy variables and contrasts first.

\hypertarget{the-matrices-we-use-for-linear-regression}{%
\subsubsection{The matrices we use for linear regression}\label{the-matrices-we-use-for-linear-regression}}

Recall that we can express our linear regression in matrix form:

\[\mathbf{y} = X\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon\]

where

\[
  \mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} 
y_1 \\\ 
y_2 \\\ 
\vdots \\\ 
y_n 
\end{pmatrix} ,
\]
\[
  \boldsymbol\beta = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_0  \\\ \beta_1  \\\ \beta_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \beta_p \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\boldsymbol\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon_1  \\\ \varepsilon_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \varepsilon_n \end{pmatrix}
\]

and

\[X = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_1 \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_n \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
1 & x_{21} & \cdots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}
\end{pmatrix}\]

We often talk about \textbf{X} as the \textbf{model matrix} (or design or regressor matrix) and it will be the focus of this section.

\hypertarget{getting-our-model-matrix-in-r}{%
\subsubsection{Getting our model matrix in R}\label{getting-our-model-matrix-in-r}}

Let's start by fitting a model with \texttt{body\_mass\_g} as the response and \texttt{flipper\_length\_mm} and \texttt{species} as the predictor variables.

(Note: Users of statistics use a lot of different words to refer to the same thing. Can you think of other terms people might use instead of \emph{response} and \emph{predictor}?)

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:

You'll notice that even though we only had an intercept and two variables, we have four columns in our model matrix. You should also notice that R has given the columns helpful names, and that we have a column for the Chinstrap species and the Gentoo species, but not the Adelie species.

Further, recall that when we are working with a categorical variables we call the different values the the variables can take \textbf{``levels''}. I may also refer to these as factor variables, and talk about the ``levels of the factor''.

What R is doing is dropping the first level (alphabetically) of the categorical variable and then creating \textbf{dummy variables} for each of the other levels.

The dropped level becomes our \textbf{reference level} and this should be familiar from interpreting summary output in previous courses where you have conducted multiple linear regressions with categorical variables.

A dummy variable is also called an indicator variable, and it \emph{indicates} whether or not the given observation takes that level or not. I.e., if the 40th penguin in this dataset had a 1 in the speciesGentoo column, then I know it is a Gentoo penguin, and that it won't have a 1 in the speciesChinstrap column because each penguin can only have one species.

More generally, the sum across the row of the dummy variables for one categorical variable will either be 0 (if that observation has the reference level) or 1 (not the reference level) but you will never have more than one `one' amongst the dummies for a given categorical variable.

\subparagraph{{[}Unassessed aside{]} Why do we have to drop one of the levels?}\label{unassessed-aside-why-do-we-have-to-drop-one-of-the-levels}}

You may recall that for the matrix calculations required to get our vector of \(\beta\)s, we need to be able to invert X our matrix. We can only invert matrices for which all the columns are linearly independent and if we have the intercept AND dummies for all the levels of the categorical variable, our matrix will be linearly dependent.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-1}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed (in each group).
\item
  Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\item
  The variances for the groups are equal.
\end{enumerate}

Notice that these are the same assumptions as the one-sample t-test, but with the equality of variances assumption added.

\hypertarget{hypotheses-1}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses-1}}

\[H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\]
\[H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2\]

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population means for both groups are the same. This differs from the one sample test because we have uncertainty about BOTH values here. Both are population parameters that we don't know.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{s^2(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} \]

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom \(df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\) and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.

\hypertarget{example-1}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-1}}

Conduct an independent t-test to test if the mean of \texttt{body\_mass\_g} is the same for male and female penguins (\texttt{sex}). Add your code below. Note: you must set \texttt{,\ var.equal\ =\ TRUE} as one of the arguments for it two be the independent t-test. If you don't set this we are conducting a \emph{Welch's t-test}. I won't be covering this, but it is covered in the source credited at the end of this activity.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  body_mass_g by sex
## t = -8.5417, df = 331, p-value = 4.897e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -840.8014 -526.0222
## sample estimates:
## mean in group female   mean in group male 
##             3862.273             4545.685
\end{verbatim}

Now, based on what we've learned, write a linear model using the \texttt{lm()} function to do the same this as our independent t-test. Save the model as \texttt{mod5}.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -1295.7  -595.7  -237.3   737.7  1754.3 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)  3862.27      56.83  67.963  < 2e-16 ***
## sexmale       683.41      80.01   8.542  4.9e-16 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 730 on 331 degrees of freedom
##   (11 observations deleted due to missingness)
## Multiple R-squared:  0.1806, Adjusted R-squared:  0.1781 
## F-statistic: 72.96 on 1 and 331 DF,  p-value: 4.897e-16
\end{verbatim}

Take a moment to match up parts of the outputs that are the same. There is a difference here in that the sign of the test statistics differs. That does not matter as out t-distribution is symmetrical and we're doing a two-tailed test.

\hypertarget{use-case-2}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case-2}}

You've probably seen `ANOVA' in the context of model comparison, but it is also a popular test in psychology and other disciplines.

Let's look specifically at one-way ANOVA (or the F-test). It tests if all the means for several groups (more than 2) are the same or if at least one is different.

I hope this sounds a bit like the next evolution from the independent t-test\ldots{}

(+ 1000 stats respect points to anyone who draws Pokemon-esque evolutions of these three tests\ldots with regression as the mega-evolution\ldots)

\hypertarget{assumptions-2}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-2}}

And it just so happens that the assumptions for the one-way ANOVA (also called the F-test) are EXACTLY the same as for the independent t-test

There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content. \url{https://gifst.blogspot.com/2019/03/snl-hi-saturday-night-live-hey-kate.html}

  The data are continuous.
\item

\item
  Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\item
  The variances for the groups are equal.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{hypotheses-2}{%

\[H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_k \]

\[H_1: \text{at least one }\mu \text{ differs from the others} \]

\hypertarget{example-2}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-2}}

Let's now look at body mass across species. Suppose we wanted to know if was believable that the the means body mass in grams was the same across all three species. This is when we could fit a quick ANOVA to test this. The \texttt{aov()} allows us to do this.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aov}\NormalTok{(body\_mass\_g }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ species, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ penguins))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##              Df    Sum Sq  Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    
## species       2 146864214 73432107   343.6 <2e-16 ***
## Residuals   339  72443483   213698                   
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 2 observations deleted due to missingness
\end{verbatim}

That looks a lot like the output from calling summary on \texttt{lm()}\ldots in fact, aov is just a wrapper for lm! Which means it has been linear regression the whole time.

\textbf{First}, (if possible) send me a chat note that you're having technical difficulties and are working to resolve them.

\textbf{Second}, leave the meeting and re-enter. This often resets things and resolves the problem. Before entering the meeting, make sure all of your devices are properly plugged in and Bluetooth devices are connected.

If that doesn't fix things, exit the meeting again and update your Zoom Client. This is the Zoom software that should be on your computer. Here's a short video tutorial explaining how to update the software: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7zERcVLUBM}.

After updating, enter the meeting again to see if this resolved your problems.

\textbf{Our synchronous classes are recorded, so if your technology is just going catastrophically wrong, go get a cup of tea/coffee/water and relax, you can catch up with the recording when it is posted on Quercus.}

\textbf{First,} check the \textbf{chat} to see if the instructor or the project mentor have said what is going on and what they are doing to fix things and follow any instructions they give.

\textbf{Second}, if they have disappeared completely, wait 10 minutes (or until the end of the meeting time, whichever comes first) before closing the call. (You can do other things in the meantime, but be ready to jump back in).

\textbf{Third}, expect to see an announcement on Quercus afterwards telling you what to do (e.g.~it might be to watch a video I'll record later, to review some slides or perhaps there is nothing to do and i'll see you next time).

*If the number of attendees is getting too close to the call cap of 300 (this is a Zoom license thing), preference will be given to those enrolled in the session and others will be asked to leave. Any Team Up! activity bonuses will also be applied-section/session does not matter.

\emph{Why can't I access the class/office hour Zoom meeting?}

You must have and be signed in with your University of Toronto Zoom account. Use the `SSO' (single sign-on) option.

\textbf{\emph{``\textbf{Will STA303/STA1002 be able to be }completed online-only?''}} Yes.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{STA303} will be a flipped course, with content delivered online and opportunities for activities both in-person (subject to health advice) and online. All assessments will be completed and submitted online.
\item
  If you are enrolled in an \textbf{in-person tutorial}, you will have an option to attend online instead.
\item
  Synchronous attendance is NOT required to pass this course, but being able to attend (online) synchronously at the times in the timetable may make things easier for you.

You can request a driver change by pressing the red exclamation mark in the top right of your Team Up! quiz.

\emph{How is the driver for our group chosen, and how can the driver pass the group ID to others in remote classes?}

Group members can decide who will be the Driver (ideally someone with a good internet connection). The Driver can pass the group ID to other members verbally through chat or microphone in breakout rooms.

\emph{The Driver of my group has to leave unexpectedly or their device has stopped functioning. How do we proceed with the quiz?}

Request for a Driver Change using the red button at the top right of your Team Up! Session. This button only provides help for Driver Changes. You may also need to speak with your instructor or TA.

\emph{Can you (Prof.~Bolton) write me a reference? I'm desperate!}

Please read my personal policy \href{https://www.lizabolton.com/references.html}{here} to get a sense of under what circumstances I could write for you, but basically, a good mark in one class is not sufficient and you need to have at least two `activities' with me. {If you believe you meet my basic criteria, you can request a reference from me \href{https://forms.office.com/r/XHqjGXjCru}{here}.} I will then accept or decline based on the the information provided.

\emph{Do you (Prof.~Bolton) have any research opportunities available?}

\textbf{Research/work study/teaching assistant opportunities:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  See the \href{https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/employment-opportunities/cupe-positions-unit-1}{Department website}. The main round of TA recruitment occurs during the summer but there are occasionally emergency postings.
\item
  Some information about opportunities with me on my \href{https://www.lizabolton.com/opportunities.html}{website}.
\item
  \textbf{Reading courses:} STA496/497: Readings in Statistics must be registered for as part of \href{https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/Undergrad/SitePages/Special-Enrolment-Courses--STA490Y1,-STA492H1-and-STA496H1-STA497H1.aspx}{special enrolment during July}. I will not be taking on any further students.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If you're thinking about the future, I usually consider taking on a small number of STA497 students for a \textbf{half-credit, year long version.}
  \item
    There is much more information about my past students, research interests and what a course with me might be like on my website: \href{https://www.lizabolton.com/reading_courses.html}{\textless https://www.lizabolton.com/reading\_courses.html\textgreater{}}.

\subsubsection{Some true things about matrices}\label{some-true-things-about-matrices}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{rank} of a matrix is the number of linearly independent columns your matrix has.\\
\item
  If the number of columns = the rank of the matrix all the columns are \textbf{linearly independent}. If the umber of columns is \textgreater{} the rank of the matrix, all the columns are \emph{not} linearly independent.\\
\item
  You can only \textbf{invert} a square matrix if all its columns are linearly independent. (Determinant non-zero).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why do we care?} In linear regression, to estimate \(\boldsymbol\beta\), our vector of coefficients, we calculate \((\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol X)^{-1}\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol Y\). The elements of \(\boldsymbol\beta\) can't be estimated if \(\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol X\) (a square matrix) isn't invertible.

Clarification to what I said in the tests activity: We usually perform regression with an intercept because we don't want to assume out line passes through the origin, \textbf{0}. So, if there is an intercept, (column of 1s in the model matrix) we must convert every categorical variable with \(k\) levels into \(k-1\) dummy variables to have the intercept and still satisfies linear independence. IF we ditch the intercept, we can have k dummies, but this is only usually useful in the specific case of ANOVA.
