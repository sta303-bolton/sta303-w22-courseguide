Hi folks,

Welcome to STA303! We're excited you're joining us on this statistical voyage. I look forward to introducing myself to you in our first class on Wednesday, but for now, there is are basic introductions below for me and our Head TA Amin. Feel free to skip to \protect\hyperlink{howthiscourseworks}{How this course works}, I know there is a lot to read in the module!

Looking forward to a great semester! See you in class on Wednesday.

Before moving (back) to Canada in 2019, I had lived more than half my life in New Zealand. (I still mention New Zealand a lot in class\ldots) My current research areas are in statistics education and online learning, as well as health disparities across ethnic groups. I used to run a small consulting company and called myself a Data Ambassador. Why? Well, lots of people are consultants. I even did an internship in management consulting once upon a time. But it wasn't a satisfying title for what I wanted my work with people to look like. I wanted something that focused on the communication and interpersonal side, not just high quality and appropriate analysis. People who aren't confident in their ability to analyse their own data need a go-between, someone who can be an ambassador for their data! While I don't do consulting any more, I love helping students build their technical and professional skills so they can go out into the world and be excellent ambassadors for data themselves.

I'm a fourth-year PhD student at the Institute of Medical Science. I have been a TA for STA130 in DoSS for the past 3 years and this is my second semester as Head TA of STA303.

My area of research is clinical Neuroscience, something I am passionate about. I analyze images of brain and eye structures in neurodegenerative diseases. I investigate possible associations of these structures with each other and with the ability to remember well and carry out goal-oriented tasks successfully. I love creating reproducible statistical analysis workflows in R. I also like audiobooks, candlelight, and apple pie (which I make myself!)

\hypertarget{hours-expectations}{%
\section{Hours expectations}\label{hours-expectations}}

While everyone has different work styles and learning needs, I want to provide some guidance around how I expect this course to look for students.

Plan to be doing 6--8 hours of work on STA303 each \emph{week.} In a two-week module, this may be comprised of:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  2--4 hours on videos and readings
\item
  1--3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities
\item
  1--2 hours on knowledge basket assessments
\item
  2--6 hours on other assessments
\item
  Remaining time attending reading announcements, office hours, checking Piazza, revision, etc.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assessments}{%
\chapter{Assessment overview}\label{assessments}}

There are two special elements of assessment/grade calculation in this course that are important to be aware of in planning your approach to it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Two roads diverged in a yellow wood}\footnote{The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost. But, dear traveller, you can in fact take both roads and then get whichever gives you the better mark. \url{https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken}}\emph{:} You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark. I will calculate your marks along both paths and then assign you the higher of the two as your final mark.
\item
  A-tisket, a-tasket\footnote{A-tisket, a-tasket by Ella Fitzgerald, \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgFkeDLpSI}}, fill up your \textbf{knowledge basket}\footnote{``Whaowhia te kete mātauranga'' is a Māori proverb meaning ``Fill up the basket of knowledge''. Mātauranga is specifically traditional Māori knowledge. You can listen to the pronunciation here \url{https://www.massey.ac.nz/student-life/m\%C4\%81ori-at-massey/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-and-tikanga-resources/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-pronunciation-and-translations/whakatauk\%C4\%AB-m\%C4\%81ori-proverbs/}}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Personalize which of these assessments you do based on your interests and skills you want to develop.
  \item
    You can `max out' your basket: just keep putting grades in until you get to 10\% (Path A) or 5\% (Path B).

\hypertarget{graduate-student-modification-1002h}{%
\section{Graduate student modification (1002H)}\label{graduate-student-modification-1002h}}

There is no difference in the grading scheme or assessment for graduate students enrolled in STA1002, other than an additional `path' to your final grade where you may opt out of the `basket' assessments, if you wish. This only applies to graduate students enrolled in STA1002, not to any students enrolled in STA303.

You don't need to advise me of your choice, I will calculate you mark all three ways above and give you the highest of those marks.

Image source: \url{https://www.nsta.org/q-if-tree-falls-forest-and-theres-no-one-around-hear-it-does-it-make-sound}

If a tree falls in a forest, and there's no one around to hear it, does it make a sound? Or, more relevant to this course, if you do a data analysis and can't share it with anyone in helpful ways, did you\emph{really} do anything? With this in mind, you will have the opportunity to choose an area of relevant professional development to pursue over the course of the semester. This could include technical skills that make you better at collaborating with others (version control, Git, GitHub), creating things others will find useful (an R package) or practising communication (oral or written).

There is a 1\% \textbf{proposal} due fairly early in the semester, and then the final submission of \textbf{evidence} of, and \textbf{reflection} on, your activity is worth 3\% and due toward the end of the semster.

Example professional development tasks include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Learning how to set up and use Git and GitHub (this might come in handy if collaborating on the final project with a group)
\item
  Setting up a personal profile website (a bit like a digital CV, GitHub provides free hosting for simple sites)
\item
  Participating in weekly TidyTuesday activities
\item
  Writing a stats blog
\item
  Developing an R package and sharing it on GitHub
\item
  A public speaking based activity like a debating society or Toastmasters
\item
  Conducting a series of interviews with industry professional or academics and publishing videos/write-ups
\item
  Create a wildly successful stats memes TikTok à la \href{https://www.tiktok.com/@chelseaparlettpelleriti/video/6811647290709757189?u_code=d894729j1bcal8\&preview_pb=0\&language=en\&timestamp=1585960235\&user_id=6736543492652696582\&utm_campaign=client_share\&app=musically\&utm_medium=ios\&user_id=6736543492652696582\&tt_from=twitter\&utm_source=twitter\&source=h5_m}{Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti} (okay, maybe not this one\ldots but she's well worth checking out)
\end{itemize}

Note: the task must be related to \textbf{communication or collaboration in some way}. For example, `learning SQL' would not be sufficiently directly related to communication or collaboration, but developing an R package and sharing it with others requires communication (writing the documentation) and is a great way to contribute to the collaborative and supportive R community. If you are not sure, please ask!

You will use the SMART goals framework (see image below) when setting out your proposal. The more thought you put into this upfront, the easier collecting evidence and reflecting on your progress will be at the end. More information will be available on the respective assessment pages when they go live.

\textbf{Activity}: Describe what you did and what you learned. Be \textbf{specific} but you don't need a step-by-step guide or dates, save that for your timesheet. Assume your reader has \emph{not} read your proposal and that you are introducing your goal and plan to them for the first time.

`Upward management' is basically managing your manager. \footnote{I used to haaaate this concept because I learned it while doing a consulting internship at a large international professional services firm and I really struggled with my manager.} If you make their life easier and help them be more effective, this should also make \emph{your} life easier and is a good investment in your own career and skills building.

While our course isn't a business, some of the basic parts of this concept apply well to your time at univeristy AND can set you up for success in graduate studies and your future career.

\textbf{But why should you put effort into upward managing me?} Well, while I will always seek to treat all students fairly and to listen to your feedback, YOU can make this easier or harder for me, and thus make this course better or worse for yourselves.

For example, if I have to use all my time and energy following up on unclear emails for more information and dealing with students who haven't followed instructions etc. etc\ldots.I won't have that energy to put into writing TeamUp! activities to give you extra practice and opportunities to earn bonus points.

In a linear model,

\(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + ... + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i\)

explanatory (or predictor) variables plus an error term.

\textbf{DATA = MODEL + ERROR}

\hypertarget{linear-regression-assumptions}{%
\section{Linear regression assumptions}\label{linear-regression-assumptions}}

\textbf{L}: your model is \textbf{L}inear.

\textbf{I}: Errors are \textbf{I}ndependent (usually satisfied if observations are independent).

\textbf{N}: Errors are \textbf{N}ormally distributed with expected value zero, \(E[\epsilon_i]=0\)

\textbf{E}: \textbf{E}qual/constant variance (homoscedasticity), \(\text{var}[\epsilon_i] = \sigma^2\).

We can express ``I N E'' above as assuming the errors are i.i.d Normal with mean of zero and variance \(\sigma^2\),
\[\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\]

\hypertarget{what-makes-it-a-linear-model}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{What makes it a \emph{linear} model?}{What makes it a linear model?}}\label{what-makes-it-a-linear-model}}

\emph{Technical note: I have had to remove code answer checking, but if you get stuck the final `Hint' is the solution. This is ungraded, so don't worry, just slightly inconvenient.}

You have probably encountered several statistical tests in your studies so far.

\hypertarget{parametric}{%
\subsubsection{Parametric}\label{parametric}}

\textbf{E.g. one-sample t-tests, paired t-tests, two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA}\\
Parametric tests make assumptions about the distribution of the population from which our sample data have been drawn.

\hypertarget{non-parametric}{%
\subsubsection{Non-parametric}\label{non-parametric}}

\textbf{E.g. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallace}\\
Non-parametric tests do not assume that our outcome is Normally distributed. They are sometimes called `distribution-free', but note that this is because they have fewer assumptions than parametric tests, not because they have no assumptions at all.

\hypertarget{aside-but-why-are-there-two-types-of-tests}{%
\subsubsection{Aside: But why are there two types of tests?}\label{aside-but-why-are-there-two-types-of-tests}}

Parametric tests are more \textbf{powerful}, i.e., they have a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one there to find. So why would you ever use a less powerful test? Well, with great power comes \sout{great responsibility} more assumptions that must be valid to proceed.

There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content. \url{https://tenor.com/view/spider-man-uncle-ben-with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-its-true-just-saying-gif-24193883}

Non-parametric tests are a great choice when your outcome is an ordinal variable, is ranks, or there are problematic outliers.

For the purposes of this lesson, we're going to focus more on parametric tests, but also take a look at the corresponding non-parametric tests with the slight white lie that they are just ranked versions of their parametric companions. This approach is pretty good as long as you have a reasonable sample size.

\emph{Imagine this:}\\
\emph{You're on a ship trying to spot land. \textbf{Parametric} tests are the crew member with the best eyesight, but they can be fussy and the conditions have to be right for them to work in or they will breakdown.}

\emph{\textbf{Non-parametric} tests are the crew member with not quite as good eyesight, but they're more laid back about the conditions you make them work in.}

In the following sections we'll explore several of these tests.

\hypertarget{one-sample-t-test}{%
\subsection{One-sample t-test}\label{one-sample-t-test}}

I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

\hypertarget{use-case}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case}}

You want to know if it is believable that the population mean is a certain value (our `hypothesized value' below).

\hypertarget{assumptions}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed.
\item
  The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\end{enumerate}

(Do these sound familiar from linear regression?)

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

\[H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}\]

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population mean is some hypothesized value.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{hypothesized val}}{s/\sqrt{n}} \]

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom df = n - 1 and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.

\hypertarget{example}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example}}

Suppose existing research suggests that the average weight of penguins is 4000 grams. You want to see if this makes sense for your new penguins data.

\[H_0: \mu = 4000\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne 4000\]

The \texttt{penguins} dataset is already loaded, you you don't have to run any libraries. Use the \texttt{t.test()} function run a one-sample t-test.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  One Sample t-test

\hypertarget{now-as-a-linear-model}{%
\subsubsection{Now as a linear model}\label{now-as-a-linear-model}}

First, consider the following, what would a linear regression with no predictor variables and just an intercept tell you?

Create a linear regression model called \texttt{mod1}(replace the blank below) that is an `intercept only model' with \texttt{body\_mass\_g} as the response.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ 1, data = penguins)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -1501.8  -651.8  -151.8   548.2  2098.2 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)  4201.75      43.36   96.89   <2e-16 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom
##   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
\end{verbatim}

It turns out the estimate from this linear regression is the same as the sample mean.

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4201.754
\end{verbatim}

Now, recall that with the t-test, we calculate our test statistic by subtracting the hypothesized value from the mean. Let's run the linear model again, but on the left-hand side of the formula, subtract the hypothesized value.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = body_mass_g - 4000 ~ 1, data = penguins)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -1501.8  -651.8  -151.8   548.2  2098.2 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)   201.75      43.36   4.652  4.7e-06 ***

## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom
##   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
\end{verbatim}

Compare the results of this \texttt{summary(mod2)} and your earlier t-test. You should see that the t value, degrees of freedom and p-value are the same for both analyses.

Thus, our one sample t-test hypotheses,
\[H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}\]

are equivalent to our linear regression hypotheses about the intercept,

\[H_0: \beta_0 = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \beta_0 \ne \text{hypothesized val}.\]

\subsubsection{The matrices we use for linear regression}\label{the-matrices-we-use-for-linear-regression}}

Recall that we can express our linear regression in matrix form:

\[\mathbf{y} = X\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon\]

where

\[
  \mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} 
y_1 \\\ 
y_2 \\\ 
\vdots \\\ 
y_n 
\end{pmatrix} ,
\]
\[
  \boldsymbol\beta = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_0  \\\ \beta_1  \\\ \beta_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \beta_p \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\boldsymbol\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon_1  \\\ \varepsilon_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \varepsilon_n \end{pmatrix}
\]

and

\[X = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_1 \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_n \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
1 & x_{21} & \cdots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}

We often talk about \textbf{X} as the \textbf{model matrix} (or design or regressor matrix) and it will be the focus of this section.

\hypertarget{getting-our-model-matrix-in-r}{%

Let's start by fitting a model with \texttt{body\_mass\_g} as the response and \texttt{flipper\_length\_mm} and \texttt{species} as the predictor variables.

(Note: Users of statistics use a lot of different words to refer to the same thing. Can you think of other terms people might use instead of \emph{response} and \emph{predictor}?)

You'll notice that even though we only had an intercept and two variables, we have four columns in our model matrix. You should also notice that R has given the columns helpful names, and that we have a column for the Chinstrap species and the Gentoo species, but not the Adelie species.

Further, recall that when we are working with a categorical variables we call the different values the the variables can take \textbf{``levels''}. I may also refer to these as factor variables, and talk about the ``levels of the factor''.

What R is doing is dropping the first level (alphabetically) of the categorical variable and then creating \textbf{dummy variables} for each of the other levels.

The dropped level becomes our \textbf{reference level} and this should be familiar from interpreting summary output in previous courses where you have conducted multiple linear regressions with categorical variables.

A dummy variable is also called an indicator variable, and it \emph{indicates} whether or not the given observation takes that level or not. I.e., if the 40th penguin in this dataset had a 1 in the speciesGentoo column, then I know it is a Gentoo penguin, and that it won't have a 1 in the speciesChinstrap column because each penguin can only have one species.

More generally, the sum across the row of the dummy variables for one categorical variable will either be 0 (if that observation has the reference level) or 1 (not the reference level) but you will never have more than one `one' amongst the dummies for a given categorical variable.

\subparagraph{{[}Unassessed aside{]} Why do we have to drop one of the levels?}\label{unassessed-aside-why-do-we-have-to-drop-one-of-the-levels}}

You may recall that for the matrix calculations required to get our vector of \(\beta\)s, we need to be able to invert X our matrix. We can only invert matrices for which all the columns are linearly independent and if we have the intercept AND dummies for all the levels of the categorical variable, our matrix will be linearly dependent.

\hypertarget{two-means}{%
\subsection{Two means}\label{two-means}}

Back to tests!

Independent t-tests let you compare two means. I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

\hypertarget{use-case-1}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case-1}}

You want to know if it is believable that two independent groups have the same population mean.

\hypertarget{assumptions-1}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-1}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed (in each group).
\item
  Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\item
  The variances for the groups are equal.
\end{enumerate}

Notice that these are the same assumptions as the one-sample t-test, but with the equality of variances assumption added.

\hypertarget{hypotheses-1}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses-1}}

\[H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\]
\[H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2\]

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population means for both groups are the same. This differs from the one sample test because we have uncertainty about BOTH values here. Both are population parameters that we don't know.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{s^2(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} \]

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom \(df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\) and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.

\hypertarget{example-1}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-1}}

Conduct an independent t-test to test if the mean of \texttt{body\_mass\_g} is the same for male and female penguins (\texttt{sex}). Add your code below. Note: you must set \texttt{,\ var.equal\ =\ TRUE} as one of the arguments for it two be the independent t-test. If you don't set this we are conducting a \emph{Welch's t-test}. I won't be covering this, but it is covered in the source credited at the end of this activity.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  body_mass_g by sex
## t = -8.5417, df = 331, p-value = 4.897e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -840.8014 -526.0222
## sample estimates:

##             3862.273             4545.685
\end{verbatim}

Now, based on what we've learned, write a linear model using the \texttt{lm()} function to do the same this as our independent t-test. Save the model as \texttt{mod5}.

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins)

## -1295.7  -595.7  -237.3   737.7  1754.3

## F-statistic: 72.96 on 1 and 331 DF,  p-value: 4.897e-16
\end{verbatim}

Take a moment to match up parts of the outputs that are the same. There is a difference here in that the sign of the test statistics differs. That does not matter as out t-distribution is symmetrical and we're doing a two-tailed test.

You've probably seen `ANOVA' in the context of model comparison, but it is also a popular test in psychology and other disciplines.

Let's look specifically at one-way ANOVA (or the F-test). It tests if all the means for several groups (more than 2) are the same or if at least one is different.

I hope this sounds a bit like the next evolution from the independent t-test\ldots{}

\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-2}}

Let's now look at body mass across species. Suppose we wanted to know if was believable that the the means body mass in grams was the same across all three species. This is when we could fit a quick ANOVA to test this. The \texttt{aov()} allows us to do this.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aov}\NormalTok{(body\_mass\_g }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ species, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ penguins))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##              Df    Sum Sq  Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    
## species       2 146864214 73432107   343.6 <2e-16 ***
## Residuals   339  72443483   213698                   
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 2 observations deleted due to missingness
\end{verbatim}

That looks a lot like the output from calling summary on \texttt{lm()}\ldots in fact, aov is just a wrapper for lm! Which means it has been linear regression the whole time.

While we've tried to keep things as streamlined as possible, there are still several different tools we'll be using this semester. Your U of T login should work with all of them. The below PDF file provides an overview of how you'll be interacting with each one.

\begin{itemize}

\section{Using RStudio with the JupyterHub}\label{using-rstudio-with-the-jupyterhub}}

We will be using R through RStudio to conduct analyses in this course. If you have a local installation of R you are welcome to continue using that, but, for this course, you do not need to have R and RStudio installed. Instead, assessments and activities will be shared through the U of T JupyterHub. This gives you access to RStudio in your browser through your U of T login on any internet-connected device. It means you don't have to fight package installations and we can instead focus on the good stuff.

\textbf{Please read through the following slides, experiment with the example sharing link, make sure you know how to knit an Rmd to pdf + export the pdf, and practice navigating and moving files.}

\subsection{What to do if you experience technical difficulties during class?}\label{what-to-do-if-you-experience-technical-difficulties-during-class}}

\textbf{First}, (if possible) send me a chat note that you're having technical difficulties and are working to resolve them.

\textbf{Second}, leave the meeting and re-enter. This often resets things and resolves the problem. Before entering the meeting, make sure all of your devices are properly plugged in and Bluetooth devices are connected.

If that doesn't fix things, exit the meeting again and update your Zoom Client. This is the Zoom software that should be on your computer. Here's a short video tutorial explaining how to update the software: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7zERcVLUBM}.

After updating, enter the meeting again to see if this resolved your problems.

\textbf{Our synchronous classes are recorded, so if your technology is just going catastrophically wrong, go get a cup of tea/coffee/water and relax, you can catch up with the recording when it is posted on Quercus.}

\subsection{What to do if your instructor or TA is experiencing technical difficulties on Zoom}\label{what-to-do-if-your-instructor-or-ta-is-experiencing-technical-difficulties-on-zoom}}

\textbf{First,} check the \textbf{chat} to see if the instructor or the project mentor have said what is going on and what they are doing to fix things and follow any instructions they give.

\textbf{Second}, if they have disappeared completely, wait 10 minutes (or until the end of the meeting time, whichever comes first) before closing the call. (You can do other things in the meantime, but be ready to jump back in).

\textbf{Third}, expect to see an announcement on Quercus afterwards telling you what to do (e.g.~it might be to watch a video I'll record later, to review some slides or perhaps there is nothing to do and i'll see you next time).

Recorded lectures will be linked on the \href{https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/204826/pages/course-overview}{Course overview} page. I aim to have the links up within 24 hours of class. They take some time to process.

\hypertarget{sections}{%
\subsubsection{Sections}\label{sections}}

\emph{Do L0101 and L0201 cover the same materials?}

Yes. The only difference is when your synchronous class is. See the below question in~ ``Attending synchronous class''.

\hypertarget{attending-synchronous-class}{%
\subsubsection{Attending synchronous class}\label{attending-synchronous-class}}

\emph{Can I attend the synchronous class for the other section?}

Yes!*

*If the number of attendees is getting too close to the call cap of 300 (this is a Zoom license thing), preference will be given to those enrolled in the session and others will be asked to leave. Any Team Up! activity bonuses will also be applied-section/session does not matter.

\emph{Why can't I access the class/office hour Zoom meeting?}

You must have and be signed in with your University of Toronto Zoom account. Use the `SSO' (single sign-on) option.

\textbf{\emph{``\textbf{Will STA303/STA1002 be able to be }completed online-only?''}} Yes.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{STA303} will be a flipped course, with content delivered online and opportunities for activities both in-person (subject to health advice) and online. All assessments will be completed and submitted online.
\item
  If you are enrolled in an \textbf{in-person tutorial}, you will have an option to attend online instead.
\item
  Synchronous attendance is NOT required to pass this course, but being able to attend (online) synchronously at the times in the timetable may make things easier for you.
\end{itemize}

\emph{``Where is your \textbf{office}?''}/\emph{``Can I come see you in-person?''} At this stage, I cannot offer in-person office hours nor student meetings in my office. Drop-ins are not currently allowed for any instructors or TAs in Statistical Sciences, unless they have told you they have organized another meeting space for this purpose.

\emph{My screen seems to be lagging compared to those of my group members (eg. I'm not on the same question as the driver/members, the answer I chose does not appear on my group members' screens, etc.)}

As long as you are logged in, you will receive your grade, so just continue to participate by communicating with your team. Almost always, your device will re-sync with the rest of your team's devices within a minute or two. If not, refresh your screen once. Repeatedly refreshing is not usually helpful!

\emph{I've been disconnected. Will my quiz progress be saved? Can I re-join my group?}

Enter the Team Up! session again and you will automatically be put back into your group. Your progress will be saved, and you will return to the question you or your group was working on. This is true for the Driver as well as any team member.

\emph{How do I send my completed quiz results?}

Click the large red ``Submit to Quercus'' button at the end of the Team Up! quiz.

\emph{Can we change our group driver?}

You can request a driver change by pressing the red exclamation mark in the top right of your Team Up! quiz.

\emph{How is the driver for our group chosen, and how can the driver pass the group ID to others in remote classes?}

Group members can decide who will be the Driver (ideally someone with a good internet connection). The Driver can pass the group ID to other members verbally through chat or microphone in breakout rooms.

\emph{The Driver of my group has to leave unexpectedly or their device has stopped functioning. How do we proceed with the quiz?}

Request for a Driver Change using the red button at the top right of your Team Up! Session. This button only provides help for Driver Changes. You may also need to speak with your instructor or TA.

Please read my personal policy \href{https://www.lizabolton.com/references.html}{here} to get a sense of under what circumstances I could write for you, but basically, a good mark in one class is not sufficient and you need to have at least two `activities' with me. {If you believe you meet my basic criteria, you can request a reference from me \href{https://forms.office.com/r/XHqjGXjCru}{here}.} I will then accept or decline based on the the information provided.

\emph{Do you (Prof.~Bolton) have any research opportunities available?}

\textbf{Research/work study/teaching assistant opportunities:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  See the \href{https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/employment-opportunities/cupe-positions-unit-1}{Department website}. The main round of TA recruitment occurs during the summer but there are occasionally emergency postings.
\item
  Some information about opportunities with me on my \href{https://www.lizabolton.com/opportunities.html}{website}.

  \textbf{Reading courses:} STA496/497: Readings in Statistics must be registered for as part of \href{https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/Undergrad/SitePages/Special-Enrolment-Courses--STA490Y1,-STA492H1-and-STA496H1-STA497H1.aspx}{special enrolment during July}. I will not be taking on any further students.

  \begin{itemize}

\subsubsection{Some true things about matrices}\label{some-true-things-about-matrices}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{rank} of a matrix is the number of linearly independent columns your matrix has.\\
\item
  If the number of columns = the rank of the matrix all the columns are \textbf{linearly independent}. If the umber of columns is \textgreater{} the rank of the matrix, all the columns are \emph{not} linearly independent.\\
\item
  You can only \textbf{invert} a square matrix if all its columns are linearly independent. (Determinant non-zero).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why do we care?} In linear regression, to estimate \(\boldsymbol\beta\), our vector of coefficients, we calculate \((\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol X)^{-1}\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol Y\). The elements of \(\boldsymbol\beta\) can't be estimated if \(\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol X\) (a square matrix) isn't invertible.

Clarification to what I said in the tests activity: We usually perform regression with an intercept because we don't want to assume out line passes through the origin, \textbf{0}. So, if there is an intercept, (column of 1s in the model matrix) we must convert every categorical variable with \(k\) levels into \(k-1\) dummy variables to have the intercept and still satisfies linear independence. IF we ditch the intercept, we can have k dummies, but this is only usually useful in the specific case of ANOVA.

Not linearly independent. Why?

Well, this intercept column is a linear combination of the three species columns!
