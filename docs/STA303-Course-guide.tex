This course guide has been created in R using the \href{https://bookdown.org/}{\texttt{bookdown}} package.

In the web version, you can put this guide into dark mode and change the font style, if you find a different display preferable. Play around with the buttons at the top of the screen and see what they do.

You can download a PDF version of the whole guide with the download button (on the web version, look for the PDF icon button at the top). Note that \emph{many} parts of this guide will be updated as the course proceeds, so the PDF might not be that useful to you unless you are separating out relevant portions for your annotations/notes, etc. Alternatively, to get just a specific chapter, you can `Print to PDF' from your browser, and this is also how you can get a PDF copy of any linked/embedded slides. Shortcut: Cmd+P or Ctrl+P, and select `Save as PDF' (or similar).

The course focuses on using and interpreting advanced statistical methods with applications in a number of different areas. The overall theme of this course is dealing with situations where the assumptions of the regression models developed in STA302 may not apply. The course is a mixture of theory and application. Assignments will involve computing with R and there is a significant focus on written and oral communication.

\hypertarget{land-acknowledgment}{%
\section{Land acknowledgment}\label{land-acknowledgment}}

The land on which our University operates is the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. With the Dish With One Spoon treaty, these peoples agreed to share and protect this land, and all those who have come here since, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, are invited into this treaty in a spirit of respect and peace. This land is also, more recently, subject to Treaty 13, a treaty between the Mississaugas and the British Crown.

In this course, we are coming together to discuss statistics, a field that has been part of historical and ongoing colonization, oppression, and harm of Indigenous peoples. Let us remind ourselves of our responsibilities to this land, its original peoples, and to each other and work to be ethical and culturally competent practitioners in our chosen fields.

We encourage you to consider the history of the land wherever you are. \url{https://www.whose.land/en/}

\hypertarget{prerequisites}{%
\section{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

STA302/1001

I.e., we will assume that you are familiar with running linear regression analyses, including checking assumptions and some of the mathematical reasoning behind the models. Material from the second-year statistical theory courses which are prerequisites to STA302 will be drawn on extensively. Knowledge of programming with R is essential.

\hypertarget{course-format-and-organization}{%
\section{Course format and organization}\label{course-format-and-organization}}

This course is composed of \textbf{five two-week modules} and \textbf{two assessment focus weeks.}

Each \textbf{module} has an ``I show you, you show me'' structure. It starts with you watching videos and/or doing readings and a guided code demonstration or other relevant class topics (``I show you''). This course is flipped, so the expectation is that you engage with some or all of the asynchronous content before Wednesday in the first week. Then you will do some or all of the following: a group problem-solving activity, practice quizzes, assessment activities.

During \textbf{assessment focus weeks}, no new content will be released.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section{Learning objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Wrangle} and \textbf{explore} a dataset
\item
  Create appropriate data \textbf{visualizations}
\item
  Describe \textbf{ethical} \textbf{considerations} in data analysis
\item
  Understand the assumptions and appropriate use cases for \textbf{linear mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models,} and \textbf{generalized additive models}
\item
  \textbf{Write} and \textbf{execute R code} for the model types covered
\item
  Accurately and appropriately \textbf{interpret} the results of the model types covered and communicate these to a range of \textbf{audiences}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{textbooks}{%
\section{Textbooks}\label{textbooks}}

You do not have to purchase a textbook for this course. There are three texts that we will use extensively, and they are all freely available to you. Additional readings will be assigned as appropriate.

\hypertarget{assessments}{%
\section{Assessments}\label{assessments}}

There are two special elements of assessment/grade calculation in this course that are important to be aware of in planning your approach to it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Two roads diverged in a yellow wood}\footnote{The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost. But, dear traveller, you can in fact take both roads and then get whichever gives you the better mark. \url{https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken}}\emph{:} You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark. I will calculate your marks along both paths and then assign you the higher of the two as your final mark. (Grad students have a third option)
\item
  A-tisket, a-tasket\footnote{A-tisket, a-tasket by Ella Fitzgerald, \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgFkeDLpSI}}, fill up your \textbf{knowledge basket}\footnote{``Whaowhia te kete mātauranga'' is a Māori proverb meaning ``Fill up the basket of knowledge''. Mātauranga is specifically traditional Māori knowledge. You can listen to the pronunciation here \url{https://www.massey.ac.nz/student-life/m\%C4\%81ori-at-massey/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-and-tikanga-resources/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-pronunciation-and-translations/whakatauk\%C4\%AB-m\%C4\%81ori-proverbs/}}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Personalize which of these assessments you do based on your interests and skills you want to develop.
  \item
    You can `max out' your basket: just keep putting grades in until you get to 10\% (Path A) or 5\% (Path B).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Everything \footnote{Mixed assessment windows are 8-8, I couldn't make the 303 work out fairly.} in STA303 is due at 3:03 p.m. ET

Note: All times in this course are in Eastern Time (Toronto time). Please note that daylight savings will begin in Canada on March 13. If you are not based in Canada this may change the time conversion for you. Please keep this in mind.

\hypertarget{hours-expectations}{%
\section{Hours expectations}\label{hours-expectations}}

While everyone has different work styles and learning needs, I want to provide some guidance around how I expect this course to look for you.

Plan to be doing 6--8 hours of work on STA303 each week. In a \textbf{two-week module}, this may look like:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  2--4 hours on videos and readings
\item
  1--3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities
\item
  1--2 hours on knowledge basket assessments
\item
  2--6 hours on other assessments
\item
  Remaining time attending reading announcements, office hours, checking Piazza, revision, etc.
\end{itemize}

Any request to have an assessment remarked must be submitted to \href{https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=JsKqeAMvTUuQN7RtVsVSEOKHUU3SzAJJhmOKjJhDWEpUNE02UzJaMUNQM0Q2U0RTOUlJS1JMM1dCTC4u}{the appropriate form} on the Forms page on Quercus under the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Wait} 24 hours after the release of grades. Use this time to go over any sample solutions and feedback, the instructions, and relevant course materials.
\item
  After the 24-hour period has finished, you will have one week to submit your regrade request. (I.e., one week + 24 hours total.)
\item
  Your request must include a detailed and thoughtful justification referring to your answer and the relevant course material to be considered. Please note that I reserve the right to review the grading of all questions or parts when you re-submit an assessment for reconsideration (i.e., your grade could go down).
\item
  You will receive a confirmation email upon submitting the form. Allow for two weeks for processing after the request window closes before following up.
\item
  The specific timeline and requirements for \textbf{final project regrade requests} will be announced later.
\end{itemize}

Only answers in English (or appropriate code, mathematical symbols) can be accepted in this course. Answers submitted in a different language will receive a 0 and will not be eligible for regrading. If you have an autotranslation extension on your browser, be very careful about how this can interact with Quercus.

\textbf{Please note that I reserve the right to review the grading of all questions or parts when you re-submit an assessment for reconsideration (i.e., your grade could go down).}

At the University of Toronto, we are part of a diverse community of students, staff, and faculty from a wide range of cultural and religious traditions. For this course, I have sought to avoid scheduling compulsory activities in ways that will clash with religious holy days (not captured by statutory holidays). If you anticipate missing a course activity due to a religious observance, please let me know as early in the course as possible. With sufficient notice---ideally at least three weeks---we can work together to make alternate arrangements.

\hypertarget{plagiarism}{%
\subsection{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}}

You may be at risk of plagiarizing if you do not understand the rules and your responsibilities. You must not present the work of others as your own. This includes, but is certainly not limited to, copying text and including it in your writing without a citation and quotation marks.

There are many resources to help you learn more:

YOU are responsible for knowing the content of the \href{http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm}{University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters}. The University of Toronto treats cases of academic misconduct very seriously. Academic integrity is a fundamental value of learning and scholarship at the U of T. Participating honestly, respectfully, responsibly, and fairly in this academic community ensures that your U of T degree is valued and respected as a true signifier of your individual academic achievement.

Other potential offences include, but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Looking at someone else's answers.
\item
  Letting someone else look at your answers.
\item
  Misrepresenting your identity.
\item
  Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University.
\item
  Falsifying institutional documents or grades.
\end{itemize}

All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following the procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please do not hesitate to contact me.

\hypertarget{specific-advice-on-untimed-assessments}{%
\subsection{Specific advice on untimed assessments}\label{specific-advice-on-untimed-assessments}}

As a general rule, for untimed assessments, I encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice. However, it is \textbf{not permitted} to share R code or written answers for anything that is to be handed in. For example, ``For question 2 what R function did you use?'' is a fair question when discussing course material with others in the class; ``Please show me your R code for question 2'' is not an appropriate question.

If writing or code is discovered to match another student's submission or outside source, this will be reported as an academic offense. \textbf{When asked to hand in code and the output it creates, the code you submit must have been used to generate the document.} If it does not (i.e., the submitted code does not match the submitted output), this is also considered an academic offense.

\hypertarget{rules-for-timed-assessments-e.g.-mixed-assessments}{%
\subsection{Rules for timed assessments (e.g., mixed assessments)}\label{rules-for-timed-assessments-e.g.-mixed-assessments}}

While all timed assessments in this course are open-book, they are not ``open-person''. You MUST NOT discuss any details of the assessment with anyone else during the assessment window, regardless of your completion status. This includes, but is not limited to, current classmates, friends, and tutors. For example, even asking someone ``which slide did you look at to answer question 3'' is not appropriate for timed assessments.

\hypertarget{note-be-careful-about-private-tutoring-companies}{%
\subsection{NOTE: BE CAREFUL ABOUT PRIVATE TUTORING COMPANIES}\label{note-be-careful-about-private-tutoring-companies}}

You may have been contacted by private tutoring companies trying to sell their services to you for statistics courses. Please be extremely careful with these services as some forms of tutoring can pose an academic offence risk. A good tutor helps you understand the subject area and supports your learning. A good tutor does not give you answers. \textbf{There are no shortcuts to learning. Learning takes time and effort.}

Be cautious about giving money to companies whose motivation is profit. They may tell you they have `insider information'. They don't. They may even offer you the opportunity to commit academic offenses. Please do not put your University of Toronto education at risk by participating in these kinds of unacceptable behaviours. If you have any questions or concerns about what is okay and what is not in your course, please ask!

I know some students absolutely hate weekly tasks and how common they have become with online learning, and that all the little tasks and deadlines can become overwhelming. I also know that cramming is the absolute worst way to learn and actually retain that learning.

This is why in this course:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I have taken things out or made them baskets options, based on student feedback
\item
  There is a knowledge basket that lets you approach frequent low-stakes practice in the way that suits you best and aims to facilitate and reward spaced repetition, the way science says is the best way to learn (\href{http://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn}{this free course is fantastic for learning more about how to learn}).

If there is something I could do differently in this area that would make your life easier and you're comfortable to tell me, please do! One thing I know isn't great but, regretfully, don't have the resources to change, is the `quality assurance' of the autogenerated captions for videos.

Before moving (back) to Canada in 2019, I had lived more than half my life in New Zealand. (I still mention New Zealand a lot in class\ldots) My current research areas are in statistics education and online learning, as well as health disparities across ethnic groups. I used to run a small consulting company and called myself a Data Ambassador. Why? Well, lots of people are consultants. I even did an internship in management consulting once upon a time. But it wasn't a satisfying title for what I wanted my work with people to look like. I wanted something that focused on the communication and interpersonal side, not just high quality and appropriate analysis. People who aren't confident in their ability to analyse their own data need a go-between, someone who can be an ambassador for their data! While I don't do consulting any more, I love helping students build their technical and professional skills so they can go out into the world and be excellent ambassadors for data themselves.

\chapter{Assessment overview}\label{assessmentsoverview}}

There are two special elements of assessment/grade calculation in this course that are important to be aware of in planning your approach to it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Two roads diverged in a yellow wood}\footnote{The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost. But, dear traveller, you can in fact take both roads and then get whichever gives you the better mark. \url{https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken}}\emph{:} You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark. I will calculate your marks along both paths and then assign you the higher of the two as your final mark. (Grad students have a third option, see below.)
\item
  A-tisket, a-tasket\footnote{A-tisket, a-tasket by Ella Fitzgerald, \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgFkeDLpSI}}, fill up your \textbf{knowledge basket}\footnote{``Whaowhia te kete mātauranga'' is a Māori proverb meaning ``Fill up the basket of knowledge''. Mātauranga is specifically traditional Māori knowledge. You can listen to the pronunciation here \url{https://www.massey.ac.nz/student-life/m\%C4\%81ori-at-massey/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-and-tikanga-resources/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-pronunciation-and-translations/whakatauk\%C4\%AB-m\%C4\%81ori-proverbs/}}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Personalize which of these assessments you do based on your interests and skills you want to develop.
  \item
    You can `max out' your basket: just keep putting grades in until you get to 5\%.

There is no difference in the grading scheme or assessment for graduate students enrolled in STA1002, other than an additional `path' to your final grade where you may opt out of the `basket' assessments, if you wish. This only applies to graduate students enrolled in STA1002, not to any students enrolled in STA303.

You don't need to advise me of your choice, I will calculate you mark all three ways above and give you the highest of those marks.

There are LOTS of ways to fill up your knowledge basket and I really encourage you to spend some time thinking about both your own working style, what the rhythym of your semester is going to look like and, most importantly, \textbf{what your personal learning and growth goals are}. Past students have told me they hated doing the writing tasks, but then embarked on a summer internship and found the practice had been really helpful to them and allowed them to stand out as both data cruncher AND communicator.

DO NOT LEAVE THIS TILL THE END! There will not be make up tasks offered if you get to the end of the semester and realize you're missing a few percentage points.

The knowledge basket activities listed in the (syllabus)(\#syllabus) are guaranteed, and there will also be some additional opportunities offered (for example the punctuation art and Team Up! options also included in the examples below).

The module writing and peer feedback activities have three stages.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Create} phase due the first Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET
\item
  \textbf{Assess} phase due the second Tuesday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{create-phase}{%
\subsection{Create phase}\label{create-phase}}

The \textbf{Create} phase is due the first Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Spend \textasciitilde30 minutes writing a response to the prompt.
\item
  Write about 200--500 words. The word count isn't strict, but the submission requirements listed below ARE.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The prompt should be clearly and comprehensively addressed.
  \item
    Your writing should be in full sentences and be broken into paragraphs as appropriate.
  \item
    Any grammatical or word choice errors should be minimal and not obstruct the meaning.
  \item
    There is a clear central idea that is well summarized in a concluding sentence(s).
  \end{itemize}

  \hypertarget{submission-requirements}{%
  \subsubsection{Submission requirements}\label{submission-requirements}}

  Your submission should be:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    typed (not handwritten)
  \item
    no more than one page
  \item
    single-spaced
  \item
    size 12 font
  \item
    margins should be no larger than 1 inch
  \item
    saved as a PDF
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assess-phase}{%
\subsection{Assess phase}\label{assess-phase}}

The \textbf{Assess} phase is due the second Tuesday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

You will need to assess TWO of your peers in this phase. You will be asked:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  if they have met the submission requirements,
\item
  to rate them on the rubric,
\item
  to make a short comment about a strength of this piece of writing,
\item
  to make a short comment about a way this piece of writing could be improved.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{reflect-phase}{%
\subsection{Reflect phase}\label{reflect-phase}}

The \textbf{Reflect} phase is due second Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Read the feedback received from your peers.
\item
  Rate the usefulness on a 3-point scale.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{general-instructions}{%
\subsection{General instructions}\label{general-instructions}}

These assessments can be used to make up your knowledge basket. They are also useful in helping you prepare for your portfolio writing samples and final project writing.

Warning: MAKE SURE YOU CLICK SUBMIT! Check that each phase is showing as submitted. Students have occasionally struggled with this in peerScholar's interface and no regrades/adjustments will be possible after the fact.

Your mark for this assessment will be based on participation. There will be separate marks for each phase, i.e., you can get part marks overall. 45\% for completing create, 45\% for completing assess, 10\% for completing reflect. Please note that participation not in the spirit of the assessment (e.g.~just putting the Lorem Ipsum text, or giving feedback like ``write better'' and nothing else) will not get you marks.

Image source: \url{https://www.nsta.org/q-if-tree-falls-forest-and-theres-no-one-around-hear-it-does-it-make-sound}

If a tree falls in a forest, and there's no one around to hear it, does it make a sound? Or, more relevant to this course, if you do a data analysis and can't share it with anyone in helpful ways, did you\emph{really} do anything? With this in mind, you will have the opportunity to choose an area of relevant professional development to pursue over the course of the semester. This could include technical skills that make you better at collaborating with others (version control, Git, GitHub), creating things others will find useful (an R package) or practising communication (oral or written).

There is a 1\% \textbf{proposal} due fairly early in the semester, and then the final submission of \textbf{evidence} of, and \textbf{reflection} on, your activity is worth 3\% and due toward the end of the semster.

Example professional development tasks include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Learning how to set up and use Git and GitHub (this might come in handy if collaborating on the final project with a group)
\item
  Setting up a personal profile website (a bit like a digital CV, GitHub provides free hosting for simple sites)
\item
  Participating in weekly TidyTuesday activities
\item
  Writing a stats blog
\item
  Developing an R package and sharing it on GitHub
\item
  A public speaking based activity like a debating society or Toastmasters
\item

Note: the task must be related to \textbf{communication or collaboration in some way}. For example, `learning SQL' would not be sufficiently directly related to communication or collaboration, but developing an R package and sharing it with others requires communication (writing the documentation) and is a great way to contribute to the collaborative and supportive R community. If you are not sure, please ask!

You will use the SMART goals framework (see image below) when setting out your proposal. The more thought you put into this upfront, the easier collecting evidence and reflecting on your progress will be at the end. More information will be available on the respective assessment pages when they go live.

Note: This is \emph{not} a collaboration/communication goal, but provides some examples of how to approach a SMART goal. Where there are ellipses (``\ldots{}'') we are suggesting there would be more of the same, but this example should be enough to give you the idea. You should \emph{not} use ellipses in this way in your own proposal.

\hypertarget{specific}{%
\subsubsection{Specific}\label{specific}}

Goal: \emph{``Climb to the peak of Mount Robson over 2 weeks in January and write one blog post for my website about the journey.''}

Bad example: ``Climb a mountain and write about it.'' Which mountain? What type of writing and with what purpose?

Resources: \emph{``I will need climbing equipment, my camera, notebook \ldots{}''}

\hypertarget{measurable}{%
\subsubsection{Measurable}\label{measurable}}

Defining success: "\emph{Reach the peak of Mount Robson and return and write at least 1 blog entry with a picture about the journey, all in 2 weeks."}

Bad example: ``Climbed Mount Robson.'' Needs more details about what this success looks like. Walk up a few metres and turn back? Relates to time-bounded also.

Measuring my progress: \emph{``I will measure my progress by how many steps of my goals I have accomplished and the altitude of my climb relative to the elevation of Mount Robson (3,954 m). I will have taken a picture''}

\hypertarget{attainable}{%
\subsubsection{Attainable}\label{attainable}}

You have or can you learn the required skills: \emph{``I am sufficiently fit to make this climb safely and have climbed a similar mountain recently. I have a camera and am currently taking an online course on blogging.''}

Possible steps I need to take:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Arrive at Mount Robson Visitors Center with my climbing plan.}
\item
  \emph{Climb until \ldots{} on first day.}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{\ldots{}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Write one blog entry with one picture.}
\end{enumerate}

Bad example: ``Make progress with my goal by 7\% each day.'' Not useful to you, what does 7\% actually mean here? Will it really be the same amount of progress every day?

Potential problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Weather might be bad, and I may have to delay my climb by a few days.}
\end{enumerate}

Bad example: ``Something might not work.'' What? In what way? Could you solve it?

\hypertarget{relevant}{%
\subsubsection{Relevant}\label{relevant}}

Personal relevance: "\emph{The climbing experience will help me learn new skills like \ldots{} which will help me work towards becoming a professional climbing guide."}

Bad example\emph{: ``Seems like fun.''}

\hypertarget{time-bounded}{%
\subsubsection{Time-bounded:}\label{time-bounded}}

\emph{``A 2-week journey from Jan 25th:Days 1-3to climb;Days4-6return;5 days for delays;3days to rest.''}

Answer the pre-knowledge check quiz questions to the best of your ability. In Quercus, you will see two assignment entries, one for the quiz and for storing your final score that takes into account completion of the quiz and the 80\%+ score or workshop engagement/attendance.

\textbf{You are welcome to use any calculator you wish and/or R.}

There are 15 points across 16 questions, so you have about 4 minutes per point. The structure is outlined below. You may find having read the syllabus first helpful for question 1.

\textbf{Office hours}: During the second half of Wednesday classes: 11:10---12:00 p.m. ET and 4:10---5:00 p.m. ET

Please do not email my individual email with STA303 questions or use Quercus mail. It makes it harder to keep track of and address your questions. Sending me messages on three different platforms will NOT speed up my response. I will not respond messages that don't follow the course communication policy.

\section{Upward management tips}\label{upward-management-tips}}

`Upward management' is basically managing your manager. \footnote{I used to haaaate this concept because I learned it while doing a consulting internship at a large international professional services firm and I really struggled with my manager.} If you make their life easier and help them be more effective, this should also make \emph{your} life easier and is a good investment in your own career and skills building.

While our course isn't a business, some of the basic parts of this concept apply well to your time at university AND can set you up for success in graduate studies and your future career.

\textbf{But why should you put effort into upward managing me?} Well, while I will always seek to treat all students fairly and to listen to your feedback, YOU can make this easier or harder for me, and thus make this course better or worse for yourselves.

For example, if I have to use all my time and energy following up on unclear emails for more information and dealing with students who haven't followed instructions etc. etc\ldots.I won't have that energy to put into writing TeamUp! activities to give you extra practice and opportunities to earn bonus points.

\item
  \textbf{In business}, this means knowing who likes face-to-face vs email, or whether your manager would rather receive an instant message than an email for a quick question.
\item
  \textbf{In STA303}, this means:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Using Piazza for all course admin and content questions.
  \item
    Using the appropriate forms for accommodations and regrade requests.
  \item
    Emailing \textbf{\href{mailto:sta303@utoronto.ca}{\nolinkurl{sta303@utoronto.ca}}} for private issues not otherwise covered by the other tools, e.g.~emailing me your Accommodation Services letter, requesting an extension to an assessment that conflicts with essential travel.

  \item
    Choosing who should be the main recipients vs CCed/BCCed.
  \item
    Ensuring your contact details are clear in your signature.
  \item
    Make sure the subject line is informative and short
  \item
    Making the text of the email as clear and concise as possible.
  \item
    Use proper grammar and punctuation.
  \item
    Don't use emoji in formal emails. If in doubt, leave 'em out.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{In STA303}, this looks like:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Everything in the right-hand column, plus the following.
  \item
    Starting an email with ``Hi Prof.~Bolton,'' or ``Hi Liza,''.\footnote{``Dear Madam'' and ``To my esteemed professor'' honestly make me uncomfortable.}
  \item
    Sign off the email with your \textbf{preferred name} (i.e.~what should I call you when I reply) and if your have different official name, include that and your UTORid below your name.

\item
  \textbf{In business}, this might look like:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Being proactive about addressing possible problems before they occur. Managers like a `no surprises' policy.
  \item
    Preparing a list of questions to cover in a meeting or to compile in an organized fashion into one email (instead of ten).
  \item
    Searching for answers yourself before asking your manager and improving your strategies for finding available information.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{In STA303}, this looks like:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Putting in a little effort into find answers before posting on Piazza/asking in class. (\emph{Have you searched Piazza? have you re-read/watched the assigned materials? have your checked the syllabus and recent announcements?})
  \item
    Come to office hours often, lists of questions very welcome!
  \item
    Getting in touch (or asking your registrar to) \textbf{early} if you might hate to miss a lot of class. It is usually easier to find a solution if I know things ahead of time, or as soon as possible after.

\subsection{Linear models}\label{linear-models}}

In a linear model,

\(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + ... + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i\)

The response is predicted by a linear function of
explanatory (or predictor) variables plus an error term.

a.k.a.

\textbf{DATA = MODEL + ERROR}

\hypertarget{linear-regression-assumptions}{%
\subsection{Linear regression assumptions}\label{linear-regression-assumptions}}

\textbf{L}: your model is \textbf{L}inear.

\textbf{I}: Errors are \textbf{I}ndependent (usually satisfied if observations are independent).

\textbf{N}: Errors are \textbf{N}ormally distributed with expected value zero, \(E[\epsilon_i]=0\)

\textbf{E}: \textbf{E}qual/constant variance (homoscedasticity), \(\text{var}[\epsilon_i] = \sigma^2\).

We can express ``I N E'' above as assuming the errors are i.i.d Normal with mean of zero and variance \(\sigma^2\),
\[\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\]

\hypertarget{what-makes-it-a-linear-model}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{What makes it a \emph{linear} model?}{What makes it a linear model?}}\label{what-makes-it-a-linear-model}}

A model is \textbf{linear} if it is \emph{linear in the parameters}. That is, all the \(\beta\) enter the model in a linear way. It is totally fine if the predictor variables enter the model in a non-linear way.

\hypertarget{linear}{%
\subsubsection{Linear}\label{linear}}

\begin{itemize}

  \(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \beta_2x_i^2 + \epsilon_i\)\\

Internally screaming ``DON'T LET THE BETAS TOUCH'' often helps me remember what is not linear. Additionally, don't let them do anything \emph{weird}, like get exponentiated.

The \texttt{glimpse} function comes from the \texttt{tibble} package, which is in loaded by the \texttt{tidyverse} package.

One of the most common issues students encounter when learning R is that they are trying to use functions that they haven't installed or loaded the package for. Make sure you've read the \href{https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/204826/pages/course-tools\#jupyter}{slides about RStudio on the JupyerHub} because packages you install there will need to be \textbf{reinstalled each session} if they are not the list of automatically available ones.
\texttt{tidyverse} is automatically available so you only need to run \texttt{library(tidyverse)} or use the namespace for the function \texttt{tibble::glimpse()}.

\hypertarget{the-variables}{%
\subsection{The variables}\label{the-variables}}

I hope most of the variables here are clear from their names. In particular, we will be interested in \texttt{species}, which has three levels (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap), \texttt{sex} (male, female, NA), \texttt{body\_mass\_g} (body mass in grams) and \texttt{flipper\_length\_mm} (length of their flippers measure in mm). We're not using the variables about the bills, but I thought this diagram was interesting anyway.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

You have probably encountered several statistical tests in your studies so far.

\hypertarget{parametric}{%
\subsubsection{Parametric}\label{parametric}}

\textbf{E.g. one-sample t-tests, paired t-tests, two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA}\\
Parametric tests make assumptions about the distribution of the population from which our sample data have been drawn.

\hypertarget{non-parametric}{%
\subsubsection{Non-parametric}\label{non-parametric}}

\textbf{E.g. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallace}\\
Non-parametric tests do not assume that our outcome is Normally distributed. They are sometimes called `distribution-free', but note that this is because they have fewer assumptions than parametric tests, not because they have no assumptions at all.

\hypertarget{aside-but-why-are-there-two-types-of-tests}{%
\subsubsection{Aside: But why are there two types of tests?}\label{aside-but-why-are-there-two-types-of-tests}}

Parametric tests are more \textbf{powerful}, i.e., they have a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one there to find. So why would you ever use a less powerful test? Well, with great power comes \sout{great responsibility} more assumptions that must be valid to proceed.

There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content. \url{https://tenor.com/view/spider-man-uncle-ben-with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-its-true-just-saying-gif-24193883}

Non-parametric tests are a great choice when your outcome is an ordinal variable, is ranks, or there are problematic outliers.

For the purposes of this lesson, we're going to focus more on parametric tests, but also take a look at the corresponding non-parametric tests with the slight white lie that they are just ranked versions of their parametric companions. This approach is pretty good as long as you have a reasonable sample size.

\emph{Imagine this:}\\
\emph{You're on a ship trying to spot land. \textbf{Parametric} tests are the crew member with the best eyesight, but they can be fussy and the conditions have to be right for them to work in or they will breakdown.}

\emph{\textbf{Non-parametric} tests are the crew member with not quite as good eyesight, but they're more laid back about the conditions you make them work in.}

In the following sections we'll explore several of these tests.

\hypertarget{one-sample-t-test}{%
\subsection{One-sample t-test}\label{one-sample-t-test}}

I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

\hypertarget{use-case}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case}}

You want to know if it is believable that the population mean is a certain value (our `hypothesized value' below).

\hypertarget{assumptions}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed.
\item
  The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\end{enumerate}

(Do these sound familiar from linear regression?)

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

\[H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}\]

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population mean is some hypothesized value.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{hypothesized val}}{s/\sqrt{n}} \]

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom df = n - 1 and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.

\hypertarget{example}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example}}

Suppose existing research suggests that the average weight of penguins is 4000 grams. You want to see if this makes sense for your new penguins data.

\[H_0: \mu = 4000\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne 4000\]

The \texttt{penguins} dataset is already loaded, you you don't have to run any libraries. Use the \texttt{t.test()} function run a one-sample t-test.

\hypertarget{now-as-a-linear-model}{%
\subsubsection{Now as a linear model}\label{now-as-a-linear-model}}

First, consider the following, what would a linear regression with no predictor variables and just an intercept tell you?

Create a linear regression model called \texttt{mod1}(replace the blank below) that is an `intercept only model' with \texttt{body\_mass\_g} as the response.

## 
## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom
##   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
\end{verbatim}

It turns out the estimate from this linear regression is the same as the sample mean.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4201.754
\end{verbatim}

Now, recall that with the t-test, we calculate our test statistic by subtracting the hypothesized value from the mean. Let's run the linear model again, but on the left-hand side of the formula, subtract the hypothesized value.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(mod2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = body_mass_g - 4000 ~ 1, data = penguins)
##

## 
## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom
##   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
\end{verbatim}

Compare the results of this \texttt{summary(mod2)} and your earlier t-test. You should see that the t value, degrees of freedom and p-value are the same for both analyses.

Thus, our one sample t-test hypotheses,
\[H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}\]

are equivalent to our linear regression hypotheses about the intercept,

\[H_0: \beta_0 = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \beta_0 \ne \text{hypothesized val}.\]

\hypertarget{wilcoxon-signed-rank-test}{%
\subsubsection{Wilcoxon signed-rank test}\label{wilcoxon-signed-rank-test}}

While the linear regression approach to the one-sample t-test is exact, we can also approximate the Wilcoxon rank-sign test with linear regression. See below.

\hypertarget{paired-sample-t-test-and-wilcoxon-matched-pair}{%
\subsubsection{Paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon matched pair}\label{paired-sample-t-test-and-wilcoxon-matched-pair}}

A paired t-test is equivalent to a one sample t-test if you just consider \(x_{\text{diff}\ i} = x_{1i} - x_{2i}\), i.e., \(x_{\text{diff}\ i}\) is the difference of the paired values for each observation, and proceed with \(x_{\text{diff}\ i}\) as you would in the one sample case. Likewise for the Wilcoxon.

The R code (not evaluated here) would be as follows:

\hypertarget{dummy-variables}{%
\subsection{Dummy variables}\label{dummy-variables}}

Let's take a quick detour before we explore the next tests. We'll need to understand the concept of dummy variables and contrasts first.

\hypertarget{the-matrices-we-use-for-linear-regression}{%
\subsubsection{The matrices we use for linear regression}\label{the-matrices-we-use-for-linear-regression}}

Recall that we can express our linear regression in matrix form:

\[\mathbf{y} = X\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon\]

where

\[
  \mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} 
y_1 \\\ 
y_2 \\\ 
\vdots \\\ 
y_n 
\end{pmatrix} ,
\]
\[
  \boldsymbol\beta = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_0  \\\ \beta_1  \\\ \beta_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \beta_p \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\boldsymbol\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon_1  \\\ \varepsilon_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \varepsilon_n \end{pmatrix}
\]

and

\[X = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_1 \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_n \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
1 & x_{21} & \cdots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}
\end{pmatrix}\]

We often talk about \textbf{X} as the \textbf{model matrix} (or design or regressor matrix) and it will be the focus of this section.

\hypertarget{getting-our-model-matrix-in-r}{%
\subsubsection{Getting our model matrix in R}\label{getting-our-model-matrix-in-r}}

Let's start by fitting a model with \texttt{body\_mass\_g} as the response and \texttt{flipper\_length\_mm} and \texttt{species} as the predictor variables.

(Note: Users of statistics use a lot of different words to refer to the same thing. Can you think of other terms people might use instead of \emph{response} and \emph{predictor}?)

You'll notice that even though we only had an intercept and two variables, we have four columns in our model matrix. You should also notice that R has given the columns helpful names, and that we have a column for the Chinstrap species and the Gentoo species, but not the Adelie species.

Further, recall that when we are working with a categorical variables we call the different values the the variables can take \textbf{``levels''}. I may also refer to these as factor variables, and talk about the ``levels of the factor''.

What R is doing is dropping the first level (alphabetically) of the categorical variable and then creating \textbf{dummy variables} for each of the other levels.

The dropped level becomes our \textbf{reference level} and this should be familiar from interpreting summary output in previous courses where you have conducted multiple linear regressions with categorical variables.

A dummy variable is also called an indicator variable, and it \emph{indicates} whether or not the given observation takes that level or not. I.e., if the 40th penguin in this dataset had a 1 in the speciesGentoo column, then I know it is a Gentoo penguin, and that it won't have a 1 in the speciesChinstrap column because each penguin can only have one species.

More generally, the sum across the row of the dummy variables for one categorical variable will either be 0 (if that observation has the reference level) or 1 (not the reference level) but you will never have more than one `one' amongst the dummies for a given categorical variable.

\subparagraph{{[}Unassessed aside{]} Why do we have to drop one of the levels?}\label{unassessed-aside-why-do-we-have-to-drop-one-of-the-levels}}

You may recall that for the matrix calculations required to get our vector of \(\beta\)s, we need to be able to invert X our matrix. We can only invert matrices for which all the columns are linearly independent and if we have the intercept AND dummies for all the levels of the categorical variable, our matrix will be linearly dependent.

\hypertarget{two-means}{%
\subsection{Two means}\label{two-means}}

Back to tests!

Independent t-tests let you compare two means. I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

\hypertarget{use-case-1}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case-1}}

You want to know if it is believable that two independent groups have the same population mean.

\hypertarget{assumptions-1}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-1}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed (in each group).
\item
  Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\item
  The variances for the groups are equal.
\end{enumerate}

Notice that these are the same assumptions as the one-sample t-test, but with the equality of variances assumption added.

\hypertarget{hypotheses-1}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses-1}}

\[H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\]
\[H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2\]

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population means for both groups are the same. This differs from the one sample test because we have uncertainty about BOTH values here. Both are population parameters that we don't know.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{s^2(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} \]

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom \(df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\) and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.

\hypertarget{example-1}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-1}}

Conduct an independent t-test to test if the mean of \texttt{body\_mass\_g} is the same for male and female penguins (\texttt{sex}). Add your code below. Note: you must set \texttt{,\ var.equal\ =\ TRUE} as one of the arguments for it two be the independent t-test. If you don't set this we are conducting a \emph{Welch's t-test}.

Take a moment to match up parts of the outputs that are the same. There is a difference here in that the sign of the test statistics differs. That does not matter as out t-distribution is symmetrical and we're doing a two-tailed test.

\hypertarget{use-case-2}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case-2}}

You've probably seen `ANOVA' in the context of model comparison, but it is also a popular test in psychology and other disciplines.

Let's look specifically at one-way ANOVA (or the F-test). It tests if all the means for several groups (more than 2) are the same or if at least one is different.

I hope this sounds a bit like the next evolution from the independent t-test\ldots{}

(+ 1000 stats respect points to anyone who draws Pokemon-esque evolutions of these three tests\ldots with regression as the mega-evolution\ldots)

\hypertarget{assumptions-2}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-2}}

And it just so happens that the assumptions for the one-way ANOVA (also called the F-test) are EXACTLY the same as for the independent t-test.

\begin{enumerate}

\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed (in each group).
\item
  Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\item
  The variances for the groups are equal.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{hypotheses-2}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses-2}}

\hypertarget{example-2}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-2}}

Let's now look at body mass across species. Suppose we wanted to know if was believable that the the means body mass in grams was the same across all three species. This is when we could fit a quick ANOVA to test this. The \texttt{aov()} allows us to do this.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aov}\NormalTok{(body\_mass\_g }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ species, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ penguins))}

\end{verbatim}

That looks a lot like the output from calling summary on \texttt{lm()}\ldots in fact, aov is just a wrapper for lm! Which means it has been linear regression the whole time.

\section{Reading strategy: previewing and skimming}\label{reading-strategy-previewing-and-skimming}}

In graduate school and/or in future employment, it is likely that you will need gather and synthesize information from a range of written sources. To decide if a source is useful to you, and to be as efficient and effective as possible, it is important to have strategies for approaching reading.

In the next module, for the knowledge basket writing task, you will be guided through reading an article called Science isn't broken and asked to respond to it. You can also keep this in mind as a stategry for `first reads' of course notes, or when re-reading to find some.

\textbf{Previewing} a written text helps you think about the origins and purpose of the text, how it is organised, and where you expect to find information.

\textbf{Skimming} is done after previewing, and is a strategy of reading key paragraphs, like the first and last which usually introduce and conclude the piece, as well as reading the opening sentences of in-between paragraphs and paying attention to figures, captions and any other emphasized text.

We will be using R through RStudio to conduct analyses in this course. If you have a local installation of R you are welcome to continue using that, but, for this course, you do not need to have R and RStudio installed. Instead, assessments and activities will be shared through the U of T JupyterHub. This gives you access to RStudio in your browser through your U of T login on any internet-connected device. It means you don't have to fight package installations and we can instead focus on the good stuff.

\textbf{Please read through the following slides, experiment with the example sharing link, make sure you know how to knit an Rmd to pdf + export the pdf, and practice navigating and moving files.}

    \item
      Solution 2: Go to \url{https://jupyter.utoronto.ca}, open a new RStudio session by going New -\textgreater{} RStudio (see slide 3 of \href{https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/resources.html\#using-rstudio-with-the-jupyterhub}{these instructions}) and move any .Rmd files in your 🏠Home directory~(see slide 10 of \href{https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/resources.html\#using-rstudio-with-the-jupyterhub}{these instructions}) to a new folder (or delete them if you don't need them).

  \item
    If \textbf{randomizing}, join the Zoom link for the tutorial time you are attending. `Arrive' on time as latecomers may not be placed in a group.
  \item
    If \textbf{working with your own group}, you don't need to join the call (but can if you get stuck with the tech!). Decide at which time you want to do the activity and set up a personal Zoom/Teams/WeChat/Instagram/carrier pigeon/semaphore chat. Zoom has nothing to do with Team Up!.

\item
  \textbf{Be kind} and constructive. You are in a team, practice being a good team member.
\item
  Team Up! does not have a great back end. If you don't submit correctly or don't join a group correctly, I CANNOT go in and check or move you around. \textbf{FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No accommodations will be made for Team Up! issues. Team Up! marks will not be updated by hand (e.g., if you end up in a solo group/tech issues, etc.).
  \end{itemize}

  You must do this as a group activity, during a tutorial time, if you wish to receive a 🧺knowledge basket grade.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{A `group' is 2--4 people.}
  \item
    All members of groups of 1 (solos) and 5+ will receive a zero. Group size is based on what is \textbf{recorded by Team Up!} through your registration with your group codes.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  You cannot do a Team Up! more than once.~ You cannot attend both sessions.
\item
  If you have a ghost 👻in your room (randomized in the class organized Zoom call), please `Ask for help' (there is a button). `Raise hand' \emph{doesn't} alert me if you're in a breakout room.

\subsection{Team Up! Instructions}\label{team-up-instructions}}

Participating in Team Up! activities can earn you knowledge basket points. They will be based on how well your team does, so work together and give it a good effort.

You will complete the following 5 steps:
.midi{[}
1. \textbf{Introductions} (first/personal name + a one-word description of how your week is going so far). Use this time to confirm everyone understands the instructions.
2. \textbf{Driver} sets up Team Up! group
3. \textbf{Members} join Team Up! group
4. Complete the activity
5. \textbf{Submit} the activity

\hypertarget{step-1-decide-on-roles}{%
\subsubsection{Step 1: Decide on roles}\label{step-1-decide-on-roles}}

You will need:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An \textbf{Instructions Master} who is responsible for helping the team follow these instructions carefully.\\
\item
  A \textbf{Screensharer} who is responsible for sharing the activity on their screen.
\item
  A \textbf{Driver} for the Team Up! side of the activity. The Driver acts as team leader, responsible for navigating the quiz,~confirming~the team's final agreed upon answer to a question, and submitting the completed quiz~score~to Quercus.The Driver has a steering wheel next to their ID and is differently coloured than other Team Members.
\end{itemize}

Team Members (other than the Driver) participate and choose vote on answers, so all team mates can see what they have chosen, but they cannot submit their choices to Team Up!.

DECIDE THIS BEFORE CLICKING ANYTHING TO DO WITH TEAM UP!

\hypertarget{step-2-driver-sets-up-group}{%
\subsubsection{Step 2: Driver sets up group}\label{step-2-driver-sets-up-group}}

The person in your group whose first/personal name comes last alphabetically will be the Leader (Driver) for the session.

\textbf{The Driver must do the below steps FIRST to get the group code.} Then they will share the group code with all the members of the group so they can also join.

1 Log-in to Quercus from your device (phone, tablet, computer).

1 Click on the Team Up! assignment from the \href{https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253305/pages/course-overview}{Course Overview} page.

2 Click `Go to Tool'. If it is not appearing, refresh your page or try a different browser.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/course-tools/gototool} \end{center}

NON-DRIVERS! DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

3 Choose ``Create New Group''

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/course-tools/choose create} \end{center}

\item
  You will need to have the \textbf{interactive activity (question document)} associated with this task open on to see the answer options and update any code. \textbf{Be prepared to switch between Team Up! and the JupyterHub tab.}
\item
  The Driver chooses a question, and the team can participate by choosing their own answers and discussing their choices with each other. Once the team decides on a final answer, the driver chooses it and clicks the Check Answer button. \textbf{Note}: The Driver can check an answer despite what the team members choose, so be careful that you have consensus before clicking the Check Answer button. You cannot undo.
\item
  If the answer is \textbf{correct}, you will be awarded the full score or ``diamonds'' for that question. You will be able to proceed onward by clicking the Next button that will appear under the Check Answer button or by clicking on a question in the menu on the left. If your team's answer is \textbf{not correct}, discuss the question and choose again. Repeat until you get the correct answer. All teammates can see whether responses are correct/incorrect as well as their team's overall score as they progress through the Team Up! session.

\item
  Please always use your real name and face for this course, and be cautious about changing them and your virtual background for other meetings. A joke background for a call with family or friends may not be appropriate for class.
\item
  For class meetings, the settings will always be that your camera and microphone are off to begin with so you have the control to check these things first.
\item
  We do ask that, when possible, you use your microphone in office hours, breakout groups and any other small group meetings and strongly prefer that you use your camera AND microphone. We trust you to make the best choice for your environment, comfort and learning.
\item
  You may get a \textbf{``This meeting is for authorized participants only message''.} Choose the ``Sign in with SSO'' option to sign in.

\subsection{What to do if you experience technical difficulties during class?}\label{what-to-do-if-you-experience-technical-difficulties-during-class}}

\textbf{First}, (if possible) send me a chat note that you're having technical difficulties and are working to resolve them.

\textbf{Second}, leave the meeting and re-enter. This often resets things and resolves the problem. Before entering the meeting, make sure all of your devices are properly plugged in and Bluetooth devices are connected.

If that doesn't fix things, exit the meeting again and update your Zoom Client. This is the Zoom software that should be on your computer. Here's a short video tutorial explaining how to update the software: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7zERcVLUBM}.

After updating, enter the meeting again to see if this resolved your problems.

\textbf{Our synchronous classes are recorded, so if your technology is just going catastrophically wrong, go get a cup of tea/coffee/water and relax, you can catch up with the recording when it is posted on Quercus.}

\subsection{What to do if your instructor or TA is experiencing technical difficulties on Zoom}\label{what-to-do-if-your-instructor-or-ta-is-experiencing-technical-difficulties-on-zoom}}

\textbf{First,} check the \textbf{chat} to see if the instructor or the project mentor have said what is going on and what they are doing to fix things and follow any instructions they give.

\textbf{Second}, if they have disappeared completely, wait 10 minutes (or until the end of the meeting time, whichever comes first) before closing the call. (You can do other things in the meantime, but be ready to jump back in).

\textbf{Third}, expect to see an announcement on Quercus afterwards telling you what to do (e.g.~it might be to watch a video I'll record later, to review some slides or perhaps there is nothing to do and i'll see you next time).

\textbf{Wednesdays}: 1st part is (recorded) content/demo and the second is office hour (unrecorded). Aiming for half-half, but will vary.

\textbf{Thursdays}: The 1st Thursday of a module will have a Team Up! or other practice activity. This will also be made available asynchronously, but the knowledge basket points for a Team Up! can only be earned by \textbf{synchronous, group participation}. The 2nd Thursday will be drop-in TA office hours to get help on content and assessments.

Thursday sessions are not recorded, but the Team Up! or other activities content will be made available to everyone. There are several other ways to earn your knowledge basket points if this doesn't suit your tech setup (e.g.~no mic) or time zone.

*If the number of attendees is getting too close to the call cap of 300 (this is a Zoom license thing), preference will be given to those enrolled in the session and others will be asked to leave. Any Team Up! activity bonuses will also be applied---section/session does not matter.

It will depend, but many should be fairly quick---a few days if autograded/based on completion. 1--2 weeks for professional development proposal and evidence \& reflection.

If you score 80\% or more on the pre-knowledge check, you automatically get 0.5\% for doing it + 0.5\% for a high score. If you do the check but get less than 80\% you get 0.5\% for completion, and can still get that additional 0.5\% if you come participate in the workshop.

Workshop open to all. And you don't have to go if you have other plan for filling your basket. It is meant to be helpful to you, though.

And no, you can't get the workshop AND 80\%+ points. One or the other for a max of 1\%.

2022-01-12: \textbf{More info over the next two weeks}, but these will be a lot like a traditional assignment, but with a writing task (the module writing tasks are good indicators and practice) and some additional narrative about what you're learning/demonstrating.

Mostly, except there will also be a small amount of pre-work. More information closer too, but the overall goal is to make it more real-world. When you prep for a big meeting in the real world, you might calculate some summary stats, have a few basic plots ready, have some notes, etc. Sure, there are some things where you'll have to think it through in the moment (in the mixed assessment and in the real world), but I hope having the untimed pre-work helps lessen some of the test anxiety folks can feel. Less mind reading, more targeted prep.

One is bigger and one is smaller. ;) But yeah, the mini has one 50 minute timed component while the main mixed assessment will have more pre-work and two 50 minute timed parts.

The `mini' is effectively practice problems for the main, but Team Up!s will also be useful practice for the mixed assessments. If there isn't a Team Up! (which you've be able to review asynchronously for study purposes) for a module I'll offer a practice quiz (no points) option or other practice activity.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{``What exactly will we do in assessment weeks?''}}{``What exactly will we do in assessment weeks?''}}\label{what-exactly-will-we-do-in-assessment-weeks}}

There is \textbf{no new content or writing module}. They are a time to focus your 6--8 hours of weekly STA303 time on the assessment. \textbf{Mixed:} doing the pre-work and the 100 minute (2 x 50) timed component. \textbf{Project week:} working with your group/self, asking questions in office hours. The expectation is that you'll start the project well before then, but I know the end of the semester can be stressful and busy, so I'm making things as simple and focused for you as I can.

\textbf{Research/work study/teaching assistant opportunities:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  See the \href{https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/employment-opportunities/cupe-positions-unit-1}{Department website}. The main round of TA recruitment occurs during the summer but there are occasionally emergency postings.
\item
  Some information about opportunities with me on my \href{https://www.lizabolton.com/opportunities.html}{website}.
\item
  \textbf{Reading courses:} STA496/497: Readings in Statistics must be registered for as part of \href{https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/Undergrad/SitePages/Special-Enrolment-Courses--STA490Y1,-STA492H1-and-STA496H1-STA497H1.aspx}{special enrolment during July}. I will not be taking on any further students.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If you're thinking about the future, I usually consider taking on a small number of STA497 students for a \textbf{half-credit, year long version.}
  \item
    There is much more information about my past students, research interests and what a course with me might be like on my website: \href{https://www.lizabolton.com/reading_courses.html}{\textless https://www.lizabolton.com/reading\_courses.html\textgreater{}}.

\subsubsection{Some true things about matrices}\label{some-true-things-about-matrices}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{rank} of a matrix is the number of linearly independent columns your matrix has.\\
\item
  If the number of columns = the rank of the matrix all the columns are \textbf{linearly independent}. If the umber of columns is \textgreater{} the rank of the matrix, all the columns are \emph{not} linearly independent.\\
\item
  You can only \textbf{invert} a square matrix if all its columns are linearly independent. (Determinant non-zero).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why do we care?} In linear regression, to estimate \(\boldsymbol\beta\), our vector of coefficients, we calculate \((\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol X)^{-1}\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol Y\). The elements of \(\boldsymbol\beta\) can't be estimated if \(\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol X\) (a square matrix) isn't invertible.

Clarification to what I said in the tests activity: We usually perform regression with an intercept because we don't want to assume out line passes through the origin, \textbf{0}. So, if there is an intercept, (column of 1s in the model matrix) we must convert every categorical variable with \(k\) levels into \(k-1\) dummy variables to have the intercept and still satisfies linear independence. IF we ditch the intercept, we can have k dummies, but this is only usually useful in the specific case of ANOVA.

Does the rank of the model matrix equal the number of columns?

Great, back to being linearly independent.

As I said at the beginning, I'm not planning to assess you on any of this. If you're interested in knowing more, or just think matrix algebra is delicious, I think this is a delightfully approachable walk through. \url{https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/132/}

\hypertarget{notetaker}{%
\subsection{Volunteer notetaker needed for STA303~}\label{notetaker}}

The volunteer notetaking program is one of the most commonly used resources provided to students registered with Accessibility Services. Here at the University of Toronto, the accessibility office is seeking dependable volunteer note-takers to assist students living with a disability to achieve academic success.

Volunteers report that by giving back to the U of T community, their class attendance and notetaking skills improve.

To become a volunteer notetaker, all you must do is attend classes regularly \& submit/upload your notes consistently/weekly. Volunteers can receive co-curricular credit(s) and/or a certificate of appreciation and/or be eligible for year-end prize draws.

\underline{To become a volunteer note-taker, please follow these 4 steps}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Register Online as a Volunteer Note-Taker at: \url{https://clockwork.studentlife.utoronto.ca/custom/misc/home.aspx}
\item
  Click on Volunteer Notetakers, and sign in using your UTORid.
\item
  Select the course(s) you wish to take notes for.~Please note:~you do NOT need to upload sample notes or be selected as a volunteer to begin uploading your notes.
\item
  Start uploading notes.
\end{enumerate}

Email us at~\href{mailto:as.notetaking@utoronto.ca}{\nolinkurl{as.notetaking@utoronto.ca}}~if you have questions or require any assistance with uploading notes. If you are no longer able to upload notes for a course, please also let us know immediately. For more information about the Accessibility Services Peer Notetaking program, please visit~\href{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/program/volunteer-note-taking}{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/program/volunteer-note-taking/}{]}. Thank you for your support and for making notes more accessible for our students.\\

\hypertarget{studentrep}{%
\subsection{Looking for student representatives for STA303}\label{studentrep}}

Our course is part of a small pilot of student representative pilot for the Department of Statistical Sciences and I am looking for two undergraduate student representatives to work with me to represent our course. (STA1002 students, there isn't a grad version of this, but you can also provide feedback to these reps and I encourage you to also reach out to me directly!)

Student representatives work with their instructor to solicit and respond to student feedback throughout the semester. Representatives talk with their instructors about how the course is going, provide feedback to the department about student needs more generally and learn about department resources so that they can help connect students to these, as relevant.

You can learn more about the experience from previous reps \href{https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/news/new-pilot-program-enhances-academic-experience-giving-students-voice}{here}.

\hypertarget{the-role-of-a-student-representative}{%
\subsubsection{The role of a student representative}\label{the-role-of-a-student-representative}}

Once a rep is selected, they will:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Attend a mandatory training session.
\item
  Have their email made available to the class on Quercus~so students can contact them.~They may also introduce themselves in a synchronous class, or write a small blurb for an announcement or create a pre-recorded video. This is up to the student/instructor team.
\item
  Reach out to students to elicit feedback. Additional~tasks~(e.g.,~helping with optional student pulse surveys or organising study groups or class events, etc.)~would be~left to the discretion of the student representative and~instructor (they are \emph{not} a required part of the program).~~
\item
  Keep in regular contact with the instructor as issues or concerns~arise.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{benefits-of-being-a-student-representative}{%
\subsubsection{Benefits of being a student representative}\label{benefits-of-being-a-student-representative}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Being part of creating a great learning experience for themselves and others.
\item
  Networking with other students and members of the Department.
\item
  Opportunities to work closely with an instructor that may mean they could be a strong referee for you and/or lead to taking a reading course with them etc.
\item
  A chance to demonstrate and improve communication, leadership,~and organisational skills.
\item
  Something to put on a CV.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-to-become-a-rep}{%
\subsubsection{How to become a rep}\label{how-to-become-a-rep}}

\textbf{If you are eligible (see below), you can~put yourself forward via~\href{https://forms.office.com/r/3ZjP0TBpQd}{this form}.} Please make sure you choose the correct section, where applicable! Student representatives for each section will be selected via lottery from the eligible students that have expressed interest by Monday, January 24 at 6:00 p.m. ET.~~

\hypertarget{eligibility-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Eligibility criteria}\label{eligibility-criteria}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You will need to be available to attend an online training, 11:10 a.m.--12:00 p.m. ET on Friday, 28 January 2022.
\item
  You must be enrolled in the section you put yourself forward for.
\item
  You \emph{don't} have to be enrolled in a DoSS program to put yourself forward for the role, though it may be of more interest/use to you if you are.
