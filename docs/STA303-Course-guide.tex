This course guide has been created in R using the \href{https://bookdown.org/}{\texttt{bookdown}} package.

In the web version, you can put this guide into dark mode and change the font style, if you find a different display preferable. Play around with the buttons at the top of the screen and see what they do.

You can download a PDF version of the whole guide with the download button (on the web version, look for the PDF icon button at the top). Note that \emph{many} parts of this guide will be updated as the course proceeds, so the PDF might not be that useful to you unless you are separating out relevant portions for your annotations/notes, etc. Alternatively, to get just a specific chapter, you can `Print to PDF' from your browser, and this is also how you can get a PDF copy of any linked/embedded slides. Shortcut: Cmd+P or Ctrl+P, and select `Save as PDF' (or similar).

The course focuses on using and interpreting advanced statistical methods with applications in a number of different areas. The overall theme of this course is dealing with situations where the assumptions of the regression models developed in STA302 may not apply. The course is a mixture of theory and application. Assignments will involve computing with R and there is a significant focus on written and oral communication.

\hypertarget{land-acknowledgment}{%
\section{Land acknowledgment}\label{land-acknowledgment}}

The land on which our University operates is the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. With the Dish With One Spoon treaty, these peoples agreed to share and protect this land, and all those who have come here since, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, are invited into this treaty in a spirit of respect and peace. This land is also, more recently, subject to Treaty 13, a treaty between the Mississaugas and the British Crown.

In this course, we are coming together to discuss statistics, a field that has been part of historical and ongoing colonization, oppression, and harm of Indigenous peoples. Let us remind ourselves of our responsibilities to this land, its original peoples, and to each other and work to be ethical and culturally competent practitioners in our chosen fields.

We encourage you to consider the history of the land wherever you are. \url{https://www.whose.land/en/}

\hypertarget{prerequisites}{%
\section{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

STA302/1001

I.e., we will assume that you are familiar with running linear regression analyses, including checking assumptions and some of the mathematical reasoning behind the models. Material from the second-year statistical theory courses which are prerequisites to STA302 will be drawn on extensively. Knowledge of programming with R is essential.

\hypertarget{course-format-and-organization}{%
\section{Course format and organization}\label{course-format-and-organization}}

This course is composed of \textbf{five two-week modules} and \textbf{two assessment focus weeks.}

Each \textbf{module} has an ``I show you, you show me'' structure. It starts with you watching videos and/or doing readings and a guided code demonstration or other relevant class topics (``I show you''). This course is flipped, so the expectation is that you engage with some or all of the asynchronous content before Wednesday in the first week. Then you will do some or all of the following: a group problem-solving activity, practice quizzes, assessment activities.

During \textbf{assessment focus weeks}, no new content will be released.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section{Learning objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Wrangle} and \textbf{explore} a dataset
\item
  Create appropriate data \textbf{visualizations}
\item
  Describe \textbf{ethical} \textbf{considerations} in data analysis
\item
  Understand the assumptions and appropriate use cases for \textbf{linear mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models,} and \textbf{generalized additive models}
\item
  \textbf{Write} and \textbf{execute R code} for the model types covered
\item
  Accurately and appropriately \textbf{interpret} the results of the model types covered and communicate these to a range of \textbf{audiences}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{textbooks}{%
\section{Textbooks}\label{textbooks}}

You do not have to purchase a textbook for this course. There are three texts that we will use extensively, and they are all freely available to you. Additional readings will be assigned as appropriate.

\hypertarget{assessments}{%
\section{Assessments}\label{assessments}}

There are two special elements of assessment/grade calculation in this course that are important to be aware of in planning your approach to it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Two roads diverged in a yellow wood}\footnote{The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost. But, dear traveller, you can in fact take both roads and then get whichever gives you the better mark. \url{https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken}}\emph{:} You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark. I will calculate your marks along both paths and then assign you the higher of the two as your final mark. (Grad students have a third option)
\item
  A-tisket, a-tasket\footnote{A-tisket, a-tasket by Ella Fitzgerald, \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgFkeDLpSI}}, fill up your \textbf{knowledge basket}\footnote{``Whaowhia te kete mātauranga'' is a Māori proverb meaning ``Fill up the basket of knowledge''. Mātauranga is specifically traditional Māori knowledge. You can listen to the pronunciation here \url{https://www.massey.ac.nz/student-life/m\%C4\%81ori-at-massey/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-and-tikanga-resources/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-pronunciation-and-translations/whakatauk\%C4\%AB-m\%C4\%81ori-proverbs/}}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Personalize which of these assessments you do based on your interests and skills you want to develop.
  \item
    You can `max out' your basket: just keep putting grades in until you get to 5\%.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hours-expectations}{%
\section{Hours expectations}\label{hours-expectations}}

While everyone has different work styles and learning needs, I want to provide some guidance around how I expect this course to look for you.

Plan to be doing 6--8 hours of work on STA303 each week. In a \textbf{two-week module}, this may look like:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  2--4 hours on videos and readings
\item
  1--3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities
\item
  1--2 hours on knowledge basket assessments
\item
  2--6 hours on other assessments

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Wait} 24 hours after the release of grades. Use this time to go over any sample solutions and feedback, the instructions, and relevant course materials.
\item
  After the 24-hour period has finished, you will have one week to submit your regrade request. (I.e., one week + 24 hours total.)
\item
  Your request must include a detailed and thoughtful justification referring to your answer and the relevant course material to be considered. Please note that I reserve the right to review the grading of all questions or parts when you re-submit an assessment for reconsideration (i.e., your grade could go down).
\item
  You will receive a confirmation email upon submitting the form. Allow for two weeks for processing after the request window closes before following up.
\item
  The specific timeline and requirements for \textbf{final project regrade requests} will be announced later.
\end{itemize}

Only answers in English (or appropriate code, mathematical symbols) can be accepted in this course. Answers submitted in a different language will receive a 0 and will not be eligible for regrading. If you have an autotranslation extension on your browser, be very careful about how this can interact with Quercus.

At the University of Toronto, we are part of a diverse community of students, staff, and faculty from a wide range of cultural and religious traditions. For this course, I have sought to avoid scheduling compulsory activities in ways that will clash with religious holy days (not captured by statutory holidays). If you anticipate missing a course activity due to a religious observance, please let me know as early in the course as possible. With sufficient notice---ideally at least three weeks---we can work together to make alternate arrangements.

\hypertarget{plagiarism}{%
\subsection{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}}

You may be at risk of plagiarizing if you do not understand the rules and your responsibilities. You must not present the work of others as your own. This includes, but is certainly not limited to, copying text and including it in your writing without a citation and quotation marks.

There are many resources to help you learn more:

YOU are responsible for knowing the content of the \href{http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm}{University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters}. The University of Toronto treats cases of academic misconduct very seriously. Academic integrity is a fundamental value of learning and scholarship at the U of T. Participating honestly, respectfully, responsibly, and fairly in this academic community ensures that your U of T degree is valued and respected as a true signifier of your individual academic achievement.

Other potential offences include, but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Looking at someone else's answers.
\item
  Letting someone else look at your answers.
\item
  Misrepresenting your identity.
\item
  Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University.
\item
  Falsifying institutional documents or grades.

All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following the procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please do not hesitate to contact me.

\hypertarget{specific-advice-on-untimed-assessments}{%
\subsection{Specific advice on untimed assessments}\label{specific-advice-on-untimed-assessments}}

As a general rule, for untimed assessments, I encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice. However, it is \textbf{not permitted} to share R code or written answers for anything that is to be handed in. For example, ``For question 2 what R function did you use?'' is a fair question when discussing course material with others in the class; ``Please show me your R code for question 2'' is not an appropriate question.

If writing or code is discovered to match another student's submission or outside source, this will be reported as an academic offense. \textbf{When asked to hand in code and the output it creates, the code you submit must have been used to generate the document.} If it does not (i.e., the submitted code does not match the submitted output), this is also considered an academic offense.

\hypertarget{rules-for-timed-assessments-e.g.-mixed-assessments}{%
\subsection{Rules for timed assessments (e.g., mixed assessments)}\label{rules-for-timed-assessments-e.g.-mixed-assessments}}

While all timed assessments in this course are open-book, they are not ``open-person''. You MUST NOT discuss any details of the assessment with anyone else during the assessment window, regardless of your completion status. This includes, but is not limited to, current classmates, friends, and tutors. For example, even asking someone ``which slide did you look at to answer question 3'' is not appropriate for timed assessments.

\hypertarget{note-be-careful-about-private-tutoring-companies}{%
\subsection{NOTE: BE CAREFUL ABOUT PRIVATE TUTORING COMPANIES}\label{note-be-careful-about-private-tutoring-companies}}

You may have been contacted by private tutoring companies trying to sell their services to you for statistics courses. Please be extremely careful with these services as some forms of tutoring can pose an academic offence risk. A good tutor helps you understand the subject area and supports your learning. A good tutor does not give you answers. \textbf{There are no shortcuts to learning. Learning takes time and effort.}

Be cautious about giving money to companies whose motivation is profit. They may tell you they have `insider information'. They don't. They may even offer you the opportunity to commit academic offenses. Please do not put your University of Toronto education at risk by participating in these kinds of unacceptable behaviours. If you have any questions or concerns about what is okay and what is not in your course, please ask!

I know some students absolutely hate weekly tasks and how common they have become with online learning, and that all the little tasks and deadlines can become overwhelming. I also know that cramming is the absolute worst way to learn and actually retain that learning.

This is why in this course:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I have taken things out or made them baskets options, based on student feedback
\item
  There is a knowledge basket that lets you approach frequent low-stakes practice in the way that suits you best and aims to facilitate and reward spaced repetition, the way science says is the best way to learn (\href{http://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn}{this free course is fantastic for learning more about how to learn}).

If there is something I could do differently in this area that would make your life easier and you're comfortable to tell me, please do! One thing I know isn't great but, regretfully, don't have the resources to change, is the `quality assurance' of the autogenerated captions for videos.

Before moving (back) to Canada in 2019, I had lived more than half my life in New Zealand. (I still mention New Zealand a lot in class\ldots) My current research areas are in statistics education and online learning, as well as health disparities across ethnic groups. I used to run a small consulting company and called myself a Data Ambassador. Why? Well, lots of people are consultants. I even did an internship in management consulting once upon a time. But it wasn't a satisfying title for what I wanted my work with people to look like. I wanted something that focused on the communication and interpersonal side, not just high quality and appropriate analysis. People who aren't confident in their ability to analyse their own data need a go-between, someone who can be an ambassador for their data! While I don't do consulting any more, I love helping students build their technical and professional skills so they can go out into the world and be excellent ambassadors for data themselves.

\chapter{Assessment overview}\label{assessmentsoverview}}

There are two special elements of assessment/grade calculation in this course that are important to be aware of in planning your approach to it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Two roads diverged in a yellow wood}\footnote{The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost. But, dear traveller, you can in fact take both roads and then get whichever gives you the better mark. \url{https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken}}\emph{:} You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark. I will calculate your marks along both paths and then assign you the higher of the two as your final mark. (Grad students have a third option, see below.)
\item
  A-tisket, a-tasket\footnote{A-tisket, a-tasket by Ella Fitzgerald, \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bgFkeDLpSI}}, fill up your \textbf{knowledge basket}\footnote{``Whaowhia te kete mātauranga'' is a Māori proverb meaning ``Fill up the basket of knowledge''. Mātauranga is specifically traditional Māori knowledge. You can listen to the pronunciation here \url{https://www.massey.ac.nz/student-life/m\%C4\%81ori-at-massey/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-and-tikanga-resources/te-reo-m\%C4\%81ori-pronunciation-and-translations/whakatauk\%C4\%AB-m\%C4\%81ori-proverbs/}}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Personalize which of these assessments you do based on your interests and skills you want to develop.
  \item
    You can `max out' your basket: just keep putting grades in until you get to 5\%.

There is no difference in the grading scheme or assessment for graduate students enrolled in STA1002, other than an additional `path' to your final grade where you may opt out of the `basket' assessments, if you wish. This only applies to graduate students enrolled in STA1002, not to any students enrolled in STA303.

You don't need to advise me of your choice, I will calculate you mark all three ways above and give you the highest of those marks.

Portfolio assessments aim to help you demonstrate your technical coding, statistical thinking, communication and reflection skills. This mini-portfolio also aims to recap and refresh knowledge from your previous statistics courses as well as building your ability to create quality data visualizations.

\hypertarget{general-instructions}{%
\section{General instructions}\label{general-instructions}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Be very careful to follow instructions on variable naming. If you do not, your code won't pass autograding and you will not receive the grades. This will not be eligible for regrading requests.
\item
  Comment your code! In an R code chunk comments start with a \# (pound sign or hastag symbol). Don't confuse this with the use of \# to denote different levels of headings in the text parts (governed by Markdown syntax) of an R Markdown document.
\item
  You should neatly format your code. No strict style is required, but make sure it is easy to read your work. (Optional) You may find \href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html\#:~:text=R\%20is\%20a\%20high\%2Dlevel,Guide\%20by\%20Hadley\%20Wickham\%20license.}{Google's R Style Guide} or the \href{https://style.tidyverse.org/}{Tidyverse Style Guide} interesting.
\item
  DO include your code in the body of the PDF itself (don't set echo=FALSE, don't hide/suppress etc.). Note that this is \emph{different} to what you will be asked to do in the final project or in professional reporting. This is a demonstration of your skills.
\item
  If asked to write and answer in words, write in full sentences.
\item
  KNIT EARLY AND OFTEN! Don't leave things till the last minute, your Rmd not knitting is not an emergency for which an extension will be granted.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{template}{%
\subsection{Template}\label{template}}

You can access the template for this assessment \href{https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fgithub.com\%2Fsta303-bolton\%2Fsta303-w22-mini-portfolio\&urlpath=rstudio\%2F\&branch=master}{here}.

There is currently a lot of `filler text' and `filler code' in the template that you will want to \textbf{delete.} Fun fact: All filler text sourced from \href{https://hipsum.co/}{Hipster Ipsum}, which Katy Wang in the UG Stats office introduced me to.

\hypertarget{submission-instructions}{%
\section{Submission instructions}\label{submission-instructions}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Submit both your Rmd (must be called: sta303-w22-mini-portfolio.Rmd) and PDF (must be called: sta303-w22-mini-portfolio.pdf) on MarkUs.
\item
  You do not need to submit any data or tex files.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{cover-page}{%
\section{Cover page}\label{cover-page}}

You don't have to use the provided template, but you DO need to write your mini-portfolio in RMarkdown and include a cover page. The cover page must have:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A title and subtitle (you can use my examples in the template or update them as you see fit, no points for changing, but it might make it a better part of your own website or GitHUb portfolio, in the future)
\item
  Your name
\item
  Date (assessment submission date is fine)
\end{itemize}

In the template, you can change the colour of this cover to any colour you would like by replacing 6C3082 in the YAML (line 11) to another hex code. You could use this tool to help you: \url{https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\emph{Write this section last or second to last (before the refection).}

In the introduction section, write a brief summary of the skills you have demonstrated in this mini-portfolio, across the statistical skills sample, writing sample and reflection sections. Think of it like a \textbf{cover letter} for this document. It should be appropriate for a fairly general audience---imagine a future employer reading this. You may want to breifly explain the course context, as you understand it. What is STA303/1002 about? (Consider the \href{https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/syllabus.html\#learning-objectives}{learning objectives in the syllabus})

Your introduction should be \textbf{no longer than 300 words} and must \textbf{fit on one page}.

\subsection{Task 1: Setting up libraries}\label{task-1-setting-up-libraries}}

Set up a chunk called \texttt{setup} where you load the \texttt{tidyverse} and \texttt{readxl} libraries. Set your chunk options to \texttt{message=FALSE} so all the package loading information isn't included in your our output. You will need to make sure you run this chunk each time you start a new session so you can use many of the functions required.

\subsection{Task 2: Visualizing the variance of a Binomial random variable for varying proportions}\label{task-2-visualizing-the-variance-of-a-binomial-random-variable-for-varying-proportions}}

\textbf{Goal}: Show visually that for a fixed value of \(n\), \(p=0.5\) will result in the largest variance for a Binomial random variable.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Choose two appropriate values of \(n>0\) for your demonstration and save them as \texttt{n1} and \texttt{n2}
\item
  Create a vector of proportions, \texttt{props}, from 0 to 1, in steps of 0.01 (Tip: use the \texttt{seq()} function).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If I suggest a function you haven't seen before, you can search its documentation in your console by typing a ? in front of the function name, e.g.~?seq.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Create a tibble (a data type in R, like a dataframe), \texttt{for\_plot}, with the vector of \texttt{props} as the first variable, and two additional variables calculating the variance for each of your two chosen n values. (Call these \texttt{n1\_var} and \texttt{n2\_var})
\item
  Create \textbf{two} plots, one for each of your values of \(n\), using \texttt{ggplot} and apply \texttt{theme\_minimal()} to each one. These should appear in your PDF and do not need to be saved with specific name.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Add an appropriate \textbf{figure caption} to each chart (use fig.cap=``Your text here'' in the R chunk settings.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      An appropriate title should succinctly explain the chart and mention the chosen n value.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Add a \textbf{caption} \emph{within} the ggplot that says ``Created by STUDENT NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022''.
  \item
    Give the x and y labels appropriate \textbf{labels}.

\item
  \texttt{props}, a numeric vector

\subsection{Task 3: Demonstrating frequentist confidence intervals as long-run probabilities of capturing a population parameter}\label{task-3-demonstrating-frequentist-confidence-intervals-as-long-run-probabilities-of-capturing-a-population-parameter}}

\textbf{Goal}: Simulate a population of size 1000, using \(N(10, 2)\), and take 100 independent, random samples of size 30 observations each from it. Calculate a Wald confidence interval (using an appropriate t-multiplier) for the population mean from each sample. Calculate what proportion of intervals contain the population mean and plot all these intervals, coloured by successful population mean capture or not.

\hypertarget{specific-steps}{%
\subsubsection{Specific steps}\label{specific-steps}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Set the seed to the last three digits of your student ID (this is your numeric student identifier number, NOT your UTORID).
\item
  Set up the following objects with the appropriate simulation parameters, sample size and number of samples.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{sim\_mean} and \texttt{sim\_sd}
  \item
    \texttt{sample\_size}
  \item
    \texttt{number\_of\_samples}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Calculate the appropriate t-multiplier (function: \texttt{qt(...)}) for constructing a 95\% confidence interval in this context. Make sure your degrees of freedom are appropriate. Save it as \texttt{tmult} for later use.
\item
  Create a vector called \texttt{population}, a simulated population using \texttt{sim\_mean} and \texttt{sim\_sd} and with 1000 values (function to generate random numbers from a normal distribution: \texttt{rnorm(...)}).
\item
  Find the \emph{actual} true mean for your population and save it as \texttt{pop\_param}. This should be a numeric vector of length 1.
\item
  Get 100 samples of size 30 from your population and save them in a vector called \texttt{sample\_set}. (This might be a little tricky/unfamiliar, so here is one way to do it. You can just copy and paste this code.)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
sample_set <- unlist(lapply(1:number_of_samples,
    function (x) sample(population, size = sample_size)))
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Create a new vector called \texttt{group\_id} that will allow you to label the values from the 100 different samples above. Hint: \texttt{rep(\ldots{})} will be useful here, and has a great little argument called \texttt{each}. Take a look at the documentation (\texttt{?rep}) to compare the behaviour of \texttt{times} and \texttt{each}.
\item
  Create a new \texttt{tibble} (a data type in R, like a dataframe), \texttt{my\_sim}, that has two columns:\texttt{group\_id} and \texttt{sample\_set.}
\item
  Create a new tibble, \texttt{ci\_vals}, that starts with the dataset \texttt{my\_sim} and then groups by \texttt{group\_id}, and summarizes appropriately to create two new columns: \texttt{mean} and \texttt{sd}, that hold the means and standard deviations. There should be one row per group.
\item
  Continue to change the tibble \texttt{ci\_vals} by adding the following variables:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{lower} and \texttt{upper}, two columns that hold the lower and upper bound of a 95\% confidence interval for the group. You will need to calculate this. Consider the equations for a confidence interval and remember that we are using a t-multiplier that you have already calculated.
  \item
    \texttt{capture} which takes the values \texttt{TRUE} if the population parameter is in the 95\% CI, and \texttt{FALSE} if not. These should be logical NOT character types.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Create an object called \texttt{proportion\_capture} that uses \texttt{ci\_vals} and stores the proportion of intervals you created that capture the population parameter. This should be done using the object names, not `hard coded', so that if you changed your set.seed or your sample size, etc., and run all the code again, it would update this value. It should be a vector of length 1.
\item
  Plot these 100 confidence intervals in one plot, with the means indicated as points, as well as and a dotted line for the population parameter. \texttt{geom\_errorbar()} will be very helpful.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Colour} the confidence intervals by whether or not they contain the population parameter.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      If the interval include the population parameter, colour it \#122451 if it DOES contain the parameter (TRUE) and \#B80000 if it DOES NOT (FALSE).
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Set the \textbf{figure caption} to ``Exploring our long-run `confidence' in confidence intervals. This figure shows how often 95\% confidence intervals from 100 simple random samples capture the population mean. The population was simulated from N(10, 2)''.
  \item
    Set the caption to ``Created by STUDENT NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022''. Replace STUDENT NAME with your name.
  \item
    Set the \textbf{legend title} to ``CI captures population parameter''.
  \item
    \textbf{Flip the coordinates} using \texttt{coord\_flip()} so the intervals are horizontal across your chart.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Add the following sentence to your Markdown (not in a code chunk):

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(`\)r proportion\_capture*100\(`\) \% of my intervals capture the the population parameter.
  \item
    Important! Use BACKTICKS around r proportion\_capture*100. Things you put in backticks with an r at the beginning will be processed as inline R code. This key is located under the escape button on many keyboards.You may need to remove some spaces compared to the above.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Briefly (\textasciitilde1 paragraph) describe why we \emph{can} include the population parameter in this plot AND why we cannot usually compare the population parameter to our confidence interval in practice (e.g., when working with data that has not been simulated). Write this for a non-statistical audience.

\subsection{Task 4: Investigating whether there is an association between cGPA and STA303/1002 students correctly answering a question on global poverty rates}\label{task-4-investigating-whether-there-is-an-association-between-cgpa-and-sta3031002-students-correctly-answering-a-question-on-global-poverty-rates}}

In the `getting to know you' survey at the beginning of STA303, students who participated in the survey were asked:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What their current cumulative grade point average (CGPA) was at U of T.
\item
  Whether the proportion of people living below the global poverty line had halved, doubled or stayed about the same in the last 20 years.
\end{itemize}

So, what was the correct answer to the question about global poverty? \href{https://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/ignorance-test/results/question-3/}{The proportion of the global population living below the poverty line has HALVED!}

In the .xlsx file called \texttt{sta303-mini-portfolio-poverty.xlsx} there are 200 observations that represent the patterns in our class but from which is is not possible to identify individual students. The final goal of this task is to test whether there is a difference in cGPA between students who correctly answered this question and those who did not.

\hypertarget{goal}{%
\subsubsection{Goal}\label{goal}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Briefly describe the goal of this task to someone who has not read these instructions and only has a general awareness of hypothesis testing. \textbf{Put it in your own words.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{wrangling-the-data}{%
\subsubsection{Wrangling the data}\label{wrangling-the-data}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Load the data, \texttt{sta303-mini-portfolio-poverty.xlsx,} into an object called \texttt{cgpa\_data}, and apply the \texttt{clean\_names()} function from the \texttt{janitor} package. Pay attention to the path to the file when providing it to R. It won't know to look in the data folder if you don't tell it.\\
\item
  Rename the cGPA variable to \texttt{cgpa} and the poverty question answer to \texttt{global\_poverty\_ans}.\\
\item
  Clean the data so only appropriate cGPA variables are included.\\
\item
  Create a new variable called \texttt{correct} that takes the value TRUE (logical, not character) if the respondent answered `Halved' and FALSE if they answered `Doubled' or "stayed about the same'.
\end{itemize}

All of the above changes should be saved into the dataset called \texttt{cgpa\_data.} I recommend using pipes \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}. There is a keyboard shortcut too: Cmd+Shift+M (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+M (Windows).

\hypertarget{visualizing-the-data}{%
\subsubsection{Visualizing the data}\label{visualizing-the-data}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a set of histograms, in one figure, positioned on top of each other, that will allow you examine the data in a useful way.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{testing}{%
\subsubsection{Testing}\label{testing}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Choose an appropriate test to test whether there is an association between cGPA and if a student in STA303/1002 answered this question correctly. JUSTIFY your choice appropriately.
\item
  Conduct the test AND the equivalent version using \texttt{lm()} \textbf{interpret the result of the test appropriately} in a sentence or two.
\end{itemize}

Recall the types of tests you have now encountered, in this and previous courses:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  T-test \texttt{t.test(x,\ data\ =\ my\_data)} or \texttt{t.test(x\textasciitilde{}y,\ data\ =\ my\_data)}
\item
  ANOVA `summary(aov(x\textasciitilde y, data = my\_data))
\item
  Wilcoxon test \texttt{wilcox.test(x,\ data\ =\ my\_data)}
\item
  Mann-Whitney U \texttt{wilcox.test(x\textasciitilde{}y,\ data\ =\ my\_data)} (note different use of wilcox function)
\item
  Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test \texttt{kruskal.test(x\textasciitilde{}y,\ data\ =\ my\_data)}
\end{itemize}

Make sure you're considering the assumptions for the tests as well as some of the other criteria about which tests we choose to reach for. You may need ask some questions in office hours or find relevant readings to help you consider the non-parametric tests. Your strategies here might be something to consider in your reflection.

There are LOTS of ways to fill up your knowledge basket and I really encourage you to spend some time thinking about both your own working style, what the rhythym of your semester is going to look like and, most importantly, \textbf{what your personal learning and growth goals are}. Past students have told me they hated doing the writing tasks, but then embarked on a summer internship and found the practice had been really helpful to them and allowed them to stand out as both data cruncher AND communicator.

DO NOT LEAVE THIS TILL THE END! There will not be make up tasks offered if you get to the end of the semester and realize you're missing a few percentage points.

The knowledge basket activities listed in the (syllabus)(\#syllabus) are guaranteed, and there will also be some additional opportunities offered (for example the punctuation art and Team Up! options also included in the examples below).

These assessments can be used to make up your knowledge basket. They are also useful in helping you prepare for your portfolio writing samples and final project writing.

Warning: MAKE SURE YOU CLICK SUBMIT! Check that each phase is showing as submitted. Students have occasionally struggled with this in peerScholar's interface and no regrades/adjustments will be possible after the fact.

Your mark for this assessment will be based on participation. There will be separate marks for each phase, i.e., you can get part marks overall. 45\% for completing create, 45\% for completing assess, 10\% for completing reflect. Please note that participation not in the spirit of the assessment (e.g.~just putting the Lorem Ipsum text, or giving feedback like ``write better'' and nothing else) will not get you marks.

Make sure you are familiar with the \protect\hyperlink{writinggeneral}{general instructions} for these types of tasks.

\hypertarget{m2-prompt}{%
\subsubsection{M2 Prompt}\label{m2-prompt}}

Read \href{https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/}{\emph{Science isn't broken}~(Aschwanden, 2015)} using the \emph{previewing} and \emph{skimming} strategy outlined below. Discuss what you learn from the article, with a focus on what you \textbf{notice~about~your own thinking}~when~playing with the \emph{"Hack Your Way~To~Scientific Glory}" interactive. Make sure you paraphrase appropriately (see \protect\hyperlink{paraphrasing}{Module 2 paraphrasing section}) and add the reference for the article. (It is okay to put the reference by itself on a second page, if required.)~

Instead of reading from beginning to end try \textbf{\emph{previewing}} and then \textbf{\emph{skimming}} to be faster:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Read the \textbf{title}. Pay attention to the ``Filed Under'' and date of publication.
\end{enumerate}

🤔\emph{Why do you think we have assigned this reading to you?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Skip the text until the \textbf{interactive figure} called ``\emph{Hack Your Way To Scientific Glory}''.
\end{enumerate}

When you change political party in section 1, or other items in section 2, how does the p-value change in section 4 of the interactive figure?

🤔\emph{What do you understand from this figure? What do you notice about your own thinking as you play with it?}

\textbf{Tip:} Reading one paragraph before and after a figure helps clarify the figure.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Skip the text until the \textbf{figure} of the football field.
\end{enumerate}

🤔 \emph{What do you understand from this figure?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Skip the text until the \textbf{figure} called ``\emph{Same Data, Different Conclusions}''.
\end{enumerate}

🤔 \emph{What do you understand from this figure?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item
  Read the two \textbf{bolded quotes}: ``\emph{Science is great, but}\ldots{}'' and ``\emph{Human fallibilities}\ldots{}''.
\item
  Read the \textbf{last paragraph} (often the concluding paragraph).
\item
  Now write your \textbf{200--500-word reflection} on what you have learned.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Paraphrase!} That is, use your own words, don't copy/paste. Use the \href{https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/204826/pages/w2-paraphrasing}{paraphrasing how-to from the week 2 module} to help you.
  \item
    Discuss what you noticed about your thinking while playing with the \emph{Hack Your Way~To~Scientific Glory}" interactive.
  \item
    Include a \textbf{conclusion} at the end.
  \item
    Use in-text \textbf{citation} as follows (Aschwanden, 2015) and put the reference at the end.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Go back and read the entire text to see if your understanding was correct.

Image source: \url{https://www.nsta.org/q-if-tree-falls-forest-and-theres-no-one-around-hear-it-does-it-make-sound}

If a tree falls in a forest, and there's no one around to hear it, does it make a sound? Or, more relevant to this course, if you do a data analysis and can't share it with anyone in helpful ways, did you\emph{really} do anything? With this in mind, you will have the opportunity to choose an area of relevant professional development to pursue over the course of the semester. This could include technical skills that make you better at collaborating with others (version control, Git, GitHub), creating things others will find useful (an R package) or practising communication (oral or written).

There is a 1\% \textbf{proposal} due fairly early in the semester, and then the final submission of \textbf{evidence} of, and \textbf{reflection} on, your activity is worth 3\% and due toward the end of the semster.

Example professional development tasks include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Learning how to set up and use Git and GitHub (this might come in handy if collaborating on the final project with a group)
\item
  Setting up a personal profile website (a bit like a digital CV, GitHub provides free hosting for simple sites)
\item
  Participating in weekly TidyTuesday activities
\item
  Writing a stats blog
\item
  Developing an R package and sharing it on GitHub
\item
  A public speaking based activity like a debating society or Toastmasters
\item
  Conducting a series of interviews with industry professional or academics and publishing videos/write-ups
\item
  Create a wildly successful stats memes TikTok à la \href{https://www.tiktok.com/@chelseaparlettpelleriti/video/6811647290709757189?u_code=d894729j1bcal8\&preview_pb=0\&language=en\&timestamp=1585960235\&user_id=6736543492652696582\&utm_campaign=client_share\&app=musically\&utm_medium=ios\&user_id=6736543492652696582\&tt_from=twitter\&utm_source=twitter\&source=h5_m}{Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti} (okay, maybe not this one\ldots but she's well worth checking out)
\end{itemize}

Note: the task must be related to \textbf{communication or collaboration in some way}. For example, `learning SQL' would not be sufficiently directly related to communication or collaboration, but developing an R package and sharing it with others requires communication (writing the documentation) and is a great way to contribute to the collaborative and supportive R community. If you are not sure, please ask!

You will use the SMART goals framework (see image below) when setting out your proposal. The more thought you put into this upfront, the easier collecting evidence and reflecting on your progress will be at the end. More information will be available on the respective assessment pages when they go live.

Goal: \emph{``Climb to the peak of Mount Robson over 2 weeks in January and write one blog post for my website about the journey.''}

\subsubsection{Measurable}\label{measurable}}

Defining success: "\emph{Reach the peak of Mount Robson and return and write at least 1 blog entry with a picture about the journey, all in 2 weeks."}

Bad example: ``Climbed Mount Robson.'' Needs more details about what this success looks like. Walk up a few metres and turn back? Relates to time-bounded also.

Measuring my progress: \emph{``I will measure my progress by how many steps of my goals I have accomplished and the altitude of my climb relative to the elevation of Mount Robson (3,954 m). I will have taken a picture''}

\hypertarget{attainable}{%
\subsubsection{Attainable}\label{attainable}}

You have or can you learn the required skills: \emph{``I am sufficiently fit to make this climb safely and have climbed a similar mountain recently. I have a camera and am currently taking an online course on blogging.''}

Possible steps I need to take:

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Arrive at Mount Robson Visitors Center with my climbing plan.}
\item
  \emph{Climb until \ldots{} on first day.}

There will be two versions of this session, each in class time on January 19, 2022, 10:10 to 11:00 a.m. and 3:10 to 4:00 p.m.

These sessions will have a short presentation from the administrators/program managers of some potentially relevant U of T graduate programs as well as a panel discussion with some of the course TAs. They will talk about their experiences, things they wish they'd know, and reference letters.

\textbf{10:00 a.m. class:} \href{https://mfi.utoronto.ca/}{Master of Financial Insurance (MFI)} and \href{https://mscac.utoronto.ca/}{Master of Science in Applied Commuting (MScAC)} administrators + TA panel

\textbf{3:00 p.m. class:} \href{https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/future-students/our-graduate-programs}{Master of Science in Statistics and PhD in Statistics} administrator (note: Alison will also share some general advice for if you're looking at program elsewhere as well) + TA panel

To earn the 0.1 points up for attending a grad school information session and panel you must attend for at least 75\% of one of the sessions (i.e., you cannot just log in and then log out again) AND complete the short questionnaire. There are three questions, you must answer Q1 and 2, but Q3 is optional.

\textbf{Notes}:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  You \emph{cannot} earn double points for attending both sessions.\\
\item
  Attendance is not required, there are plenty of other ways to earn 🧺knowledge basket points.\\
\item
  You can attend either session (or both, if you really wanted). There are no section restrictions for STA303.

\textbf{Prof.~Liza Bolton}

\textbf{Course email}: \href{mailto:sta303@utoronto.ca}{\nolinkurl{sta303@utoronto.ca}}

\textbf{Office hours}: During the second half of Wednesday classes: 11:10---12:00 p.m. ET and 4:10---5:00 p.m. ET

Please do not email my individual email with STA303 questions or use Quercus mail. It makes it harder to keep track of and address your questions. Sending me messages on three different platforms will NOT speed up my response. I will not respond messages that don't follow the course communication policy.

\hypertarget{upward-management-tips}{%
\section{Upward management tips}\label{upward-management-tips}}

`Upward management' is basically managing your manager. \footnote{I used to haaaate this concept because I learned it while doing a consulting internship at a large international professional services firm and I really struggled with my manager.} If you make their life easier and help them be more effective, this should also make \emph{your} life easier and is a good investment in your own career and skills building.

While our course isn't a business, some of the basic parts of this concept apply well to your time at university AND can set you up for success in graduate studies and your future career.

\textbf{But why should you put effort into upward managing me?} Well, while I will always seek to treat all students fairly and to listen to your feedback, YOU can make this easier or harder for me, and thus make this course better or worse for yourselves.

For example, if I have to use all my time and energy following up on unclear emails for more information and dealing with students who haven't followed instructions etc. etc\ldots.I won't have that energy to put into writing TeamUp! activities to give you extra practice and opportunities to earn bonus points.

\hypertarget{communicate-using-the-tools-your-manager-prefers}{%
\subsection{Communicate using the tools your manager prefers}\label{communicate-using-the-tools-your-manager-prefers}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{In business}, this means knowing who likes face-to-face vs email, or whether your manager would rather receive an instant message than an email for a quick question.
\item
  \textbf{In STA303}, this means:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Using Piazza for all course admin and content questions.
  \item
    Using the appropriate forms for accommodations and regrade requests.
  \item
    Emailing \textbf{\href{mailto:sta303@utoronto.ca}{\nolinkurl{sta303@utoronto.ca}}} for private issues not otherwise covered by the other tools, e.g.~emailing me your Accommodation Services letter, requesting an extension to an assessment that conflicts with essential travel.
  \item
    Asking questions in office hours.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{write-good-emails-when-emails-are-appropriate}{%
\subsection{Write good emails (when emails are appropriate)}\label{write-good-emails-when-emails-are-appropriate}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{In business}, this might mean:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Choosing who should be the main recipients vs CCed/BCCed.
  \item
    Ensuring your contact details are clear in your signature.
  \item
    Make sure the subject line is informative and short
  \item
    Making the text of the email as clear and concise as possible.
  \item
    Use proper grammar and punctuation.
  \item
    Don't use emoji in formal emails. If in doubt, leave 'em out.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{In STA303}, this looks like:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Everything in the right-hand column, plus the following.
  \item
    Starting an email with ``Hi Prof.~Bolton,'' or ``Hi Liza,''.\footnote{``Dear Madam'' and ``To my esteemed professor'' honestly make me uncomfortable.}
  \item
    Sign off the email with your \textbf{preferred name} (i.e.~what should I call you when I reply) and if your have different official name, include that and your UTORid below your name.
  \item
    Subject line including {[}Prof.~Bolton{]} or {[}TA name{]} if your email is for a specific person.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{understand-your-managers-goals}{%
\subsection{Understand your manager's goals}\label{understand-your-managers-goals}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{In business}, this might look like understanding their KPIs and how you can help make sure these are met.
\item
  \textbf{In STA303}, most of \emph{my} goals are \emph{for you}, like that you learn useful statistical skills, improve your writing skills etc. I also personally want to improve as an instructor and have fun talking about something I love.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You can help me with these goals by working on this course every week, trying your best, asking for help early and often, engaging with feedback gathering mechanisms and providing constructive feedback if something is not working.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{In business}, this might look like:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Being proactive about addressing possible problems before they occur. Managers like a `no surprises' policy.
  \item
    Preparing a list of questions to cover in a meeting or to compile in an organized fashion into one email (instead of ten).
  \item
    Searching for answers yourself before asking your manager and improving your strategies for finding available information.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{In STA303}, this looks like:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Putting in a little effort into find answers before posting on Piazza/asking in class. (\emph{Have you searched Piazza? have you re-read/watched the assigned materials? have your checked the syllabus and recent announcements?})
  \item
    Come to office hours often, lists of questions very welcome!
  \item
    Getting in touch (or asking your registrar to) \textbf{early} if you might hate to miss a lot of class. It is usually easier to find a solution if I know things ahead of time, or as soon as possible after.

\section{Recap of linear models}\label{recap-of-linear-models}}

\hypertarget{why-model}{%
\subsection{Why model?}\label{why-model}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The goal of a model is to provide a (relatively) simple summary of a dataset.
\item
  We can describe data AND make predictions.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{linear-models}{%
\subsection{Linear models}\label{linear-models}}

In a linear model,

\(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + ... + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i\)

The response is predicted by a linear function of
explanatory (or predictor) variables plus an error term.

a.k.a.

\textbf{DATA = MODEL + ERROR}

\hypertarget{linear-regression-assumptions}{%
\subsection{Linear regression assumptions}\label{linear-regression-assumptions}}

\textbf{L}: your model is \textbf{L}inear.

\textbf{I}: Errors are \textbf{I}ndependent (usually satisfied if observations are independent).

\textbf{N}: Errors are \textbf{N}ormally distributed with expected value zero, \(E[\epsilon_i]=0\)

\textbf{E}: \textbf{E}qual/constant variance (homoscedasticity), \(\text{var}[\epsilon_i] = \sigma^2\).

We can express ``I N E'' above as assuming the errors are i.i.d Normal with mean of zero and variance \(\sigma^2\),
\[\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\]

\hypertarget{what-makes-it-a-linear-model}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{What makes it a \emph{linear} model?}{What makes it a linear model?}}\label{what-makes-it-a-linear-model}}

A model is \textbf{linear} if it is \emph{linear in the parameters}. That is, all the \(\beta\) enter the model in a linear way. It is totally fine if the predictor variables enter the model in a non-linear way.

\hypertarget{linear}{%
\subsubsection{Linear}\label{linear}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \beta_2x_i^2 + \epsilon_i\)\\
\item
  \(y_i = \beta_0 + γ_1δ_1x_{1i} + \beta_2\exp(x_{2i}) + \epsilon_i\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{not-linear}{%
\subsubsection{NOT linear}\label{not-linear}}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \(y_i = \beta_0 exp(\beta_1x_{1i}) + \epsilon_i\)
\end{itemize}

Internally screaming ``DON'T LET THE BETAS TOUCH'' often helps me remember what is not linear. Additionally, don't let them do anything \emph{weird}, like get exponentiated.

\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{glimpse} function comes from the \texttt{tibble} package, which is in loaded by the \texttt{tidyverse} package.

One of the most common issues students encounter when learning R is that they are trying to use functions that they haven't installed or loaded the package for. Make sure you've read the \href{https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/204826/pages/course-tools\#jupyter}{slides about RStudio on the JupyerHub} because packages you install there will need to be \textbf{reinstalled each session} if they are not the list of automatically available ones.
\texttt{tidyverse} is automatically available so you only need to run \texttt{library(tidyverse)} or use the namespace for the function \texttt{tibble::glimpse()}.

\hypertarget{the-variables}{%
\subsection{The variables}\label{the-variables}}

I hope most of the variables here are clear from their names. In particular, we will be interested in \texttt{species}, which has three levels (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap), \texttt{sex} (male, female, NA), \texttt{body\_mass\_g} (body mass in grams) and \texttt{flipper\_length\_mm} (length of their flippers measure in mm). We're not using the variables about the bills, but I thought this diagram was interesting anyway.

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

You have probably encountered several statistical tests in your studies so far.

\hypertarget{parametric}{%
\subsubsection{Parametric}\label{parametric}}

\textbf{E.g. one-sample t-tests, paired t-tests, two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA}\\
Parametric tests make assumptions about the distribution of the population from which our sample data have been drawn.

\hypertarget{non-parametric}{%
\subsubsection{Non-parametric}\label{non-parametric}}

\textbf{E.g. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallace}\\
Non-parametric tests do not assume that our outcome is Normally distributed. They are sometimes called `distribution-free', but note that this is because they have fewer assumptions than parametric tests, not because they have no assumptions at all.

\hypertarget{aside-but-why-are-there-two-types-of-tests}{%
\subsubsection{Aside: But why are there two types of tests?}\label{aside-but-why-are-there-two-types-of-tests}}

Parametric tests are more \textbf{powerful}, i.e., they have a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one there to find. So why would you ever use a less powerful test? Well, with great power comes \sout{great responsibility} more assumptions that must be valid to proceed.

There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content. \url{https://tenor.com/view/spider-man-uncle-ben-with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-its-true-just-saying-gif-24193883}

Non-parametric tests are a great choice when your outcome is an ordinal variable, is ranks, or there are problematic outliers.

For the purposes of this lesson, we're going to focus more on parametric tests, but also take a look at the corresponding non-parametric tests with the slight white lie that they are just ranked versions of their parametric companions. This approach is pretty good as long as you have a reasonable sample size.

\emph{Imagine this:}\\
\emph{You're on a ship trying to spot land. \textbf{Parametric} tests are the crew member with the best eyesight, but they can be fussy and the conditions have to be right for them to work in or they will breakdown.}

\emph{\textbf{Non-parametric} tests are the crew member with not quite as good eyesight, but they're more laid back about the conditions you make them work in.}

In the following sections we'll explore several of these tests.

\hypertarget{one-sample-t-test}{%
\subsection{One-sample t-test}\label{one-sample-t-test}}

I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

\hypertarget{use-case}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case}}

You want to know if it is believable that the population mean is a certain value (our `hypothesized value' below).

\hypertarget{assumptions}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed.
\item
  The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\end{enumerate}

(Do these sound familiar from linear regression?)

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

\[H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}\]

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population mean is some hypothesized value.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{hypothesized val}}{s/\sqrt{n}} \]

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom df = n - 1 and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.

\hypertarget{example}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example}}

Suppose existing research suggests that the average weight of penguins is 4000 grams. You want to see if this makes sense for your new penguins data.

\[H_0: \mu = 4000\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne 4000\]

The \texttt{penguins} dataset is already loaded, you you don't have to run any libraries. Use the \texttt{t.test()} function run a one-sample t-test.

\hypertarget{now-as-a-linear-model}{%
\subsubsection{Now as a linear model}\label{now-as-a-linear-model}}

First, consider the following, what would a linear regression with no predictor variables and just an intercept tell you?

Create a linear regression model called \texttt{mod1}(replace the blank below) that is an `intercept only model' with \texttt{body\_mass\_g} as the response.

## 
## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom
##   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
\end{verbatim}

It turns out the estimate from this linear regression is the same as the sample mean.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4201.754
\end{verbatim}

Now, recall that with the t-test, we calculate our test statistic by subtracting the hypothesized value from the mean. Let's run the linear model again, but on the left-hand side of the formula, subtract the hypothesized value.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(mod2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = body_mass_g - 4000 ~ 1, data = penguins)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -1501.8  -651.8  -151.8   548.2  2098.2

## 
## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom
##   (2 observations deleted due to missingness)
\end{verbatim}

Compare the results of this \texttt{summary(mod2)} and your earlier t-test. You should see that the t value, degrees of freedom and p-value are the same for both analyses.

Thus, our one sample t-test hypotheses,
\[H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}\]

are equivalent to our linear regression hypotheses about the intercept,

\[H_0: \beta_0 = \text{hypothesized val}\]
\[H_1: \beta_0 \ne \text{hypothesized val}.\]

\hypertarget{wilcoxon-signed-rank-test}{%

\subsubsection{Paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon matched pair}\label{paired-sample-t-test-and-wilcoxon-matched-pair}}

A paired t-test is equivalent to a one sample t-test if you just consider \(x_{\text{diff}\ i} = x_{1i} - x_{2i}\), i.e., \(x_{\text{diff}\ i}\) is the difference of the paired values for each observation, and proceed with \(x_{\text{diff}\ i}\) as you would in the one sample case. Likewise for the Wilcoxon.

The R code (not evaluated here) would be as follows:

\hypertarget{the-matrices-we-use-for-linear-regression}{%
\subsubsection{The matrices we use for linear regression}\label{the-matrices-we-use-for-linear-regression}}

Recall that we can express our linear regression in matrix form:

\[\mathbf{y} = X\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon\]

where

\[
  \mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} 
y_1 \\\ 
y_2 \\\ 
\vdots \\\ 
y_n 
\end{pmatrix} ,
\]
\[
  \boldsymbol\beta = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_0  \\\ \beta_1  \\\ \beta_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \beta_p \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\boldsymbol\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon_1  \\\ \varepsilon_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \varepsilon_n \end{pmatrix}
\]

and

\[X = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_1 \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_n \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
1 & x_{21} & \cdots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}
\end{pmatrix}\]

We often talk about \textbf{X} as the \textbf{model matrix} (or design or regressor matrix) and it will be the focus of this section.

You'll notice that even though we only had an intercept and two variables, we have four columns in our model matrix. You should also notice that R has given the columns helpful names, and that we have a column for the Chinstrap species and the Gentoo species, but not the Adelie species.

Further, recall that when we are working with a categorical variables we call the different values the the variables can take \textbf{``levels''}. I may also refer to these as factor variables, and talk about the ``levels of the factor''.

What R is doing is dropping the first level (alphabetically) of the categorical variable and then creating \textbf{dummy variables} for each of the other levels.

The dropped level becomes our \textbf{reference level} and this should be familiar from interpreting summary output in previous courses where you have conducted multiple linear regressions with categorical variables.

A dummy variable is also called an indicator variable, and it \emph{indicates} whether or not the given observation takes that level or not. I.e., if the 40th penguin in this dataset had a 1 in the speciesGentoo column, then I know it is a Gentoo penguin, and that it won't have a 1 in the speciesChinstrap column because each penguin can only have one species.

More generally, the sum across the row of the dummy variables for one categorical variable will either be 0 (if that observation has the reference level) or 1 (not the reference level) but you will never have more than one `one' amongst the dummies for a given categorical variable.

\subparagraph{{[}Unassessed aside{]} Why do we have to drop one of the levels?}\label{unassessed-aside-why-do-we-have-to-drop-one-of-the-levels}}

You may recall that for the matrix calculations required to get our vector of \(\beta\)s, we need to be able to invert X our matrix. We can only invert matrices for which all the columns are linearly independent and if we have the intercept AND dummies for all the levels of the categorical variable, our matrix will be linearly dependent.

\hypertarget{two-means}{%
\subsection{Two means}\label{two-means}}

Back to tests!

Independent t-tests let you compare two means. I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

\hypertarget{use-case-1}{%
\subsubsection{Use case}\label{use-case-1}}

You want to know if it is believable that two independent groups have the same population mean.

\hypertarget{assumptions-1}{%
\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-1}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The data are continuous.
\item
  The data are normally distributed (in each group).
\item
  Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
\item
  The variances for the groups are equal.
\end{enumerate}

Notice that these are the same assumptions as the one-sample t-test, but with the equality of variances assumption added.

\hypertarget{hypotheses-1}{%
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses-1}}

\[H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\]
\[H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2\]

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population means for both groups are the same. This differs from the one sample test because we have uncertainty about BOTH values here. Both are population parameters that we don't know.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

\[ t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{s^2(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} \]

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom \(df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\) and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.

\hypertarget{example-1}{%
\subsubsection{Example}\label{example-1}}

Conduct an independent t-test to test if the mean of \texttt{body\_mass\_g} is the same for male and female penguins (\texttt{sex}). Add your code below. Note: you must set \texttt{,\ var.equal\ =\ TRUE} as one of the arguments for it two be the independent t-test. If you don't set this we are conducting a \emph{Welch's t-test}. I won't be covering this, but it is covered in the source credited at the end of this activity.

Now, based on what we've learned, write a linear model using the \texttt{lm()} function to do the same this as our independent t-test. Save the model as \texttt{mod5}.

Take a moment to match up parts of the outputs that are the same. There is a difference here in that the sign of the test statistics differs. That does not matter as out t-distribution is symmetrical and we're doing a two-tailed test.

You've probably seen `ANOVA' in the context of model comparison, but it is also a popular test in psychology and other disciplines.

Let's look specifically at one-way ANOVA (or the F-test). It tests if all the means for several groups (more than 2) are the same or if at least one is different.

I hope this sounds a bit like the next evolution from the independent t-test\ldots{}

(+ 1000 stats respect points to anyone who draws Pokemon-esque evolutions of these three tests\ldots with regression as the mega-evolution\ldots)

Let's now look at body mass across species. Suppose we wanted to know if was believable that the the means body mass in grams was the same across all three species. This is when we could fit a quick ANOVA to test this. The \texttt{aov()} allows us to do this.

That looks a lot like the output from calling summary on \texttt{lm()}\ldots in fact, aov is just a wrapper for lm! Which means it has been linear regression the whole time.

\section{Reading strategy: previewing and skimming}\label{previewskim}}

In graduate school and/or in future employment, it is likely that you will need gather and synthesize information from a range of written sources. To decide if a source is useful to you, and to be as efficient and effective as possible, it is important to have strategies for approaching reading.

In the next module, for the knowledge basket writing task, you will be guided through reading an article called Science isn't broken and asked to respond to it. You can also keep this in mind as a stategry for `first reads' of course notes, or when re-reading to find some.

\textbf{Previewing} a written text helps you think about the origins and purpose of the text, how it is organised, and where you expect to find information.

\textbf{Skimming} is done after previewing, and is a strategy of reading key paragraphs, like the first and last which usually introduce and conclude the piece, as well as reading the opening sentences of in-between paragraphs and paying attention to figures, captions and any other emphasized text.

\hypertarget{introduction-to-module-2}{%
\section{Introduction to Module 2}\label{introduction-to-module-2}}

This module introduces or recaps a range of necessary data wrangling and visualization skills as well as concepts about ethical professional practice for statisticians, and statistical communication information.

With respect to the ethical professional practice components, think of this as just a very high-level survey of these ideas; we aren't going very deep on any of them, but some will set up conversations/tasks later in the course.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We'll revisit some of these concepts in later classes, like \textbf{case-control studies} and logistic regression, \textbf{black box algorithms} (very briefly) when we discuss GAMs and issues of confounding, proxies and ethical sourcing of data, throughout.
\item
  We'll touch on \textbf{web scraping} in the Team Up! activity for this module.
\end{itemize}

Folks who have taken or TAed STA130 might be more familiar with some of these concepts than others, but I'm not assuming much prior knowledge.

\hypertarget{readings-for-this-module}{%
\section{Readings for this module}\label{readings-for-this-module}}

There are several required readings in this module. Keep in mind the \protect\hyperlink{previewskim}{previewing and skimming strategies} discussed in Module 1.

\hypertarget{r-for-data-science-story-time}{%
\subsection{R for Data Science (+ story time)}\label{r-for-data-science-story-time}}

Hadley Wickham is a bit of rockstar 👨‍🎤 in the R world \footnote{My friend literally got him to sign their laptop\ldots{}}. If you took part in the Independent Summer Statistics Community (ISSC), you're probably already well aware of my love for his and Garrett's excellent book, \emph{R for Data Science}. When I brought on a new consultant for my business in New Zealand, he was transitioning from organic chemistry and wanted to become a better data analyst. He worked through this book and in just a few months was leading the analysis for client engagements. It is also the first resource to which I point students who are interested in extra materials for data science.

In the case study section of this module, I'll walk you through a case study using a range of the functions introduced in these chapters and some personal favourites. After these readings and the case study, you should be ready to start your portfolio assessments.

For the \protect\hyperlink{portfolio}{portfolio assessment}, you will be asked to write some advice to future you, based on the article \emph{Common misconceptions about data analysis and statistics} by Harvey J. Motulsky.

Focus on what surprised you, what you didn't know before, what you don't want to forget. You can disagree with the article's claims, too.

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Each \textbf{variable} must have its own \textbf{column}.
\item
  Each \textbf{observation} must have its own \textbf{row}.

\begin{quote}
``For a given dataset, it is usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.'' (Wickham, 2014)
\end{quote}

A general rule of thumb:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It is easier to describe functional relationships between variables (e.g., z is a linear combination of x and y, density is the ratio of weight to volume) than between rows.
\item
  It is easier to make comparisons between groups of observations (e.g., average of group A vs.~average of group B) than between groups of columns.

\item
  Try it yourself first with the file that has ``\_guided'' in the name and then watch the video.\\
\item
  Follow along with the video. I'll be using the file with ``\_minimal'' in the name.
\end{enumerate}

I've tried to design it so either way will work, but I think following along with the video \emph{might} be the best use of your time, if it works for your learning style.

\item
  \protect\hyperlink{making-decisions-with-data}{making decisions with data}: algorithmic bias and transparency.
\end{itemize}

There is a lot of ground covered, though lightly, and it may feel intimidating or overwhelming---there is so much to consider, so much we could get wrong! So, here is some advice from our TA Sonia Markes, who was part of crating this module: \emph{developing the judgment and skills related to these topics takes time and no analysis is ever perfect---we rely on collaboration with other scientists and statisticians who all try to think critically to avoid harm and to improve our collective knowledge and understanding.}

\hypertarget{why-should-statisticians-be-ethical}{%
\subsection{Why should statisticians be ethical?}\label{why-should-statisticians-be-ethical}}

I hope this questions seems a bit silly to most of you, shouldn't we all strive to be ethical in our professional and personal lives? Well regardless of your personal philosophy, there are additional considerations with respect to our professional ethics.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Professional societies:} You may have heard of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath}{Hippocratic oath} (``first do no harm'') in Medicine and there are similar codes of conduct for Statisticians (\protect\hyperlink{ethicscodes}{see the links to the Canadian and US version below}) through our own professional societies.
\item
  \textbf{Research ethics boards:} If you are conducting research within universities, it will often have to be approved by a research ethics board. You need to have the skills and knowledge to help appropriately design studies that can be approved under these rules.
\item
  \textbf{Legal and business considerations:} Unethical behaviour can also get you are your future employers into trouble. There are of course reputational risks, but there can also be legal risks for creating algorithms that discriminate against protected attributes like gender or ethnicity.
\end{itemize}

Statistical tools are used to create knowledge. Therefore, anyone using statistical tools is responsible for the knowledge they create through their data collection and analyses.

As ethical statisticians it is important to:
+ be accurate in our analyses and conclusions
+ be alert to possible consequences of our results/recommendations on others
+ be honest in reporting results, even when we don't get the results we hoped for
+ be respectful of other reasonable results (based on well-conducted research) even if they differ from our own
+ be mindful of what your data represents, especially if it represents people or their behaviour (a study on people has \emph{subjects}, not objects)
+ share credit when our work is based on the ideas of others
+ and more\ldots{}

You will be asked to write your own code of ethics in your final project.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/m2/confounding_image} \end{center}

In an \textbf{observational study}, variables are ``observed'' (measured and recorded) without manipulation of variables or conditions by the researcher.

Two variables are \textbf{confounded} if their effects on the response variable are mixed together and there is no way to separate them out. If this is the case, we have no way of determining which variable is causing changes to the response.

\textbf{Example:} As ice creams sales rise, so do drownings. But are people drowning because of ice cream? What would be a plausible confounder for this relationship? (Hint: ☀️🌡️️)

There is no `test' for confounding. But this is a great thing if you don't want the robots to take your job anytime soon. We need smart people who can think well about confounding.

\textbf{When we have data from an observational study, we can often only conclude association between variables, not causation.} It is worth noting that methods of causal inference are significant area of research for statisticians and others.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/m2/picard} \end{center}

\paragraph{Designing studies to avoid confounding}\label{designing-studies-to-avoid-confounding}}

In an \textbf{experiment} (or \textbf{randomized trial} or \textbf{randomized control trial}) variables and/or conditions are manipulated by the researcher and the impact on other variable(s) is measured and recorded.

The key is to randomly assign some individuals to one treatment (or condition) and randomly assign others to another treatment (sometimes this other treatment is a \textbf{control}) \emph{Note: you can have more than two treatments groups too---what is important is that individuals are randomly assigned to them!}

The groups (before treatments are applied) should be very similar to each other with respect to the other variables. Any differences between individuals in the treatment and control groups would just be due to random chance!

If there is a \textbf{significant difference} in the \textbf{outcome} between the two groups, we may have evidence that there is a \textbf{causal relationship} between the treatment and the outcome.

Science is not a magic wand that turns everything it touches to truth. Instead, ``science operates as a procedure of uncertainty reduction,'' said Nosek, of the Center for Open Science. ``The goal is to get less wrong over time.''

\hypertarget{human-research-ethics}{%
\subsubsection{Human research ethics}\label{human-research-ethics}}

Ethical codes often emerge out of crisis events.

The Nuremberg code was formulated in August 1947 in Nuremberg, Germany, by American judges \footnote{Did this judgment mean Americans were always getting research ethics right? Definitely not. (Optional) \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afwK2CVpc9E}{YouTube video about the Tuskegee Study}} sitting in judgment of Nazi doctors accused of conducting murderous and torturous human experiments in concentration camps during the war.

The Nuremberg code codified many of our standard principles of ethical research, including:
+ research must appropriately balance risk and potential benefits
+ researchers must be well-versed in their discipline and ground human experiments in animal trials.

\subparagraph{Comprehension}\label{comprehension}}

The manner and context in which information is conveyed is as important as the information itself. For example, presenting information in a disorganized or rapid manner (with too little time to think about it or ask questions), may limit a participant's ability to make an informed choice.

\hypertarget{voluntariness}{%

\item
  I will request data at a reasonable rate. I will strive to never be confused for a DDoS attack.
\item
  I will only save the data I absolutely need from your page. If all I need is OpenGraph meta-data, that's all I'll keep.
\item
  I will respect any content I do keep. I'll never pass it off as my own.
\item

\paragraph{Terms and Conditions and Robots.txt}\label{terms-and-conditions-and-robots.txt}}

Many sites give instructions about what you're allowed and not allowed to do on them.
One way is through the Terms and Conditions and another is through a file called robots.txt.

\textbf{T\&Cs}

Ideally, we should all be reading all the Terms and Conditions of all the websites we use\ldots and of course I'm sure you dooooo.

But when in a hurry, search (CTRL+F or CMD+F) ``scrape'', ``harvest'' ``crawl'' and if none of those come up then ``data'' and ``copied'' more generally and that can give you a sense if they prohibit certain uses.

\hypertarget{robots.txt}{%
\paragraph{Robots.txt}\label{robots.txt}}

Most large websites have a robots.txt page to give instructions about what `robots' are and aren't allowed to visit the page. This is most often used for search engines, but we can check them too. Bad bots can still do what they want.

More on these protocols (and templates you could add to your own site here).

API stands for \textbf{a} pplication \textbf{p} rogramming \textbf{i} nterface.

It is a structured way for data (broadly) requests to be made and fulfilled with computers.

I like \href{https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/}{this} comparison to a restaurant menu. You don't need to know HOW to make crème brûlée to be able to know you WANT it.

If you are using an API, there still may be rules about things like how many requests you can make in a certain time frame and rate limiting. Make sure you're aware of these rules and behave in the spirit of them!

\subsubsection{Indigenous data sovereignty}\label{indigenous-data-sovereignty}}

Countries and nations tend to want data collected and stored about them/their people to be subject to their laws. You might see examples of this in how government agencies require any cloud storage they use to have the servers be based within their boundaries. This area of thinking is often called \textbf{data sovereignty}.

Canada is one of many countries with a history of colonization by settler peoples and the displacement of, discrimination against, and in many cases mass murder of the Indigenous peoples. As countries like Canada go through processes of truth and reconciliation to address these violent and oppressive histories, \emph{indigenous data sovereignty} has also become a growing area of thought.

Why do statisticians needs to know about this? Because we must move from data gathering and analysis as further tools of oppression and be part of honouring the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples and nations over their own data.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Be aware of Indigenous rights and interests in relation to data.
\item
  Understand protocols for consulting with Indigenous peoples about data collection, access and use.
\item
  Ensure data for and about Indigenous peoples we are given access to is safeguarded and protected.
\item
  Support quality and integrity of Indigenous data and its collection.
\item
  Advocate for Indigenous involvement in the governance of data repositories.
\item
  Support the development of Indigenous data infrastructure and security systems.
\end{enumerate}

+ Reflecting on Land Acknowledgements
+ Speaking Our Truths: The Journey Towards Reconciliation \textbar{} 2 days P1 \& P2

As well as being important knowledge for working and living in the Canadian context, as we go forwards there is going to be a competitive \emph{disadvantage} to being ignorant about these issues if seeking work in government, health and social agencies. Many private sector organizations are also making developing these competencies a priority in staff education.

\hypertarget{selection-bias}{%
\subsubsection{Selection bias}\label{selection-bias}}

Selection bias can occur in a range of ways, but the key feature is that your sample is not representative of the population.

\textbf{Example}: Suppose I want to email out a survey to investigate if U of T students think statistics is important for their future career. I only have the emails for students I teach\ldots in statistics courses. If I randomly sample from this list of students, can I make claims about the population of all U of T students? No.

\textbf{Example}: \emph{The healthy migrant effect}. It has been noticed in many countries that migrants have mortality advantages over local-born populations. While there are several possible things going on and being researched in this area, these findings likely show a component of `selection bias' in that usually only healthy people can migrate, either due to health screening requirements in the country to which they are migrating, or by people with health complications self-selecting out due to inability/disinclination.

Survivorship bias is a specific type of selection bias.

If you've spent any time on LinkedIn, and probably lots of other social media sites, you've probably seen an image like this one. Is it inspiring? Sure, maybe\ldots. BUT as an attempted claim about the value of failure it commits the logical error of focusing on just the people who eventually succeeded. I'm sure there are plenty of unemployed, divorced, university dropouts \emph{not} writing \emph{Parry Hotter and the Windows OS}\ldots{}

In our readings for this module, the reproducibility crisis, P-hacking and HARKing have been discussed. I won't cover P-hacking or the reproducibilty crisis any further, as these readings are great introductions, but the next few slides talk a little more about \textbf{HARKing} and \textbf{multiple testing problems}.

\hypertarget{harking}{%
\subsubsection{HARKing}\label{harking}}

HARKing is ``\textbf{H} ypothesizing \textbf{A} fter the \textbf{R} esults are \textbf{K} nown''.

I sometimes talk about this as the `no peeking rule' in setting up hypotheses. For example, you should never pick a one-tailed hypothesis test because of your data, it should only be based on findings from previous studies or a physical theory of a phenomenon.

There is a good introduction to this idea in the \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007\%2Fs00210-014-1037-6}{Motulsky paper} you have been assigned for your portfolio assessment ). (Think the XKCD jelly bean comic!)

There are critiques about whether HARKing is as harmful to science as sometimes claimed and a lot of yummy philosophy of science that we won't go into. If you're interested in this area, try reading Rubin (2017), \href{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/gpr0000128}{``When Does HARKing Hurt? Identifying When Different Types of Undisclosed Post Hoc Hypothesizing Harm Scientific Progress''} (optional).

\hypertarget{multiple-testing-problem}{%
\subsubsection{Multiple testing problem}\label{multiple-testing-problem}}

One of my favourite examples of positive academic trolling is the dead salmon study. The study used methodology for exploring animal reactions to human emotions expressed in photographs through fMRI scans.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/m2/salmon} \end{center}

If the researchers had ignored the issue of multiple comparisons (there are thousands of areas for which brain activation is measured) they might have ended up with test results that claimed the (dead) salmon was engaging in `perspective-taking' when shown the photos of the humans. (It was not).

See the poster here: \url{http://prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.pdf}

This is the reason we would want to run an \protect\hyperlink{anova}{ANOVA} when we have more than two groups to compare the means of, instead of doing multiple t-tests between every pair of levels and it is mentioned in conjunction with HARKing in \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007\%2Fs00210-014-1037-6}{Motulsky paper}.

\textbf{\emph{But what is actually going on here?}}

Suppose you've picked a significance level of \(\alpha = 0.05\). When conducting just one test this means we're accepting a 5\% risk of making a Type 1 Error, that is, rejecting the null hypothesis when we shouldn't. BUT, if we are conducting several tests at the same time, then we need to think about our \textbf{family-wise error rate}, which is our chance of making at least one Type 1 Error across all our tests.

So, if you are making a Type 1 Error 5\% of the time, the idea is that 95\% of the time you're not. And while 95\% is pretty good, if you're doing \(m\) independent tests, the not-making-an-error rate becomes \(0.95^m\), e.g., if you're doing \(20\) tests, \(0.95^{20}=0.359\), meaning the chance of making at least one `false discovery' is now \(\sim64\%\)

\hypertarget{correcting-for-multiple-comparisons}{%
\paragraph{Correcting for multiple comparisons?}\label{correcting-for-multiple-comparisons}}

There are multiple methods investigators employ in an effort to have their Type 1 Error across multiple tests actually reflect the error rate they are comfortable with.

The simplest but most conservative of these is the Bonferroni correction where you just divide your significance level (e.g., 0.05) by the number of tests you are conducting and use that as the new significance cut off.

E.g. If you'd usually use a 5\% threshold and are doing 20 tests, your new threshold is \[\alpha_{adjusted} = \frac{0.05}{20} = 0.0025.\]
As you can see, this is now a much stronger level of evidence we're requiring against our null hypothesis than when doing a single test.

Prediction models are taught what they ``know'' from training data. Training data can be incomplete, biased, or skewed. This can result in
\textbf{algorithmic bias}.

\hypertarget{proxy-variables}{%
\paragraph{Proxy variables}\label{proxy-variables}}

There can also be situations where we know we DON'T want to use a variable as part of an algorithm, for ethical and often legal reasons (anti-discrimination laws about gender, race, health status, e.g.~American's with Disabilities Act means you can't discriminate against people with mental health conditions). BUT there might be other variables in your data, like certain types of hobbies/memberships, home address, `personality' quiz questions, that act as `proxies' for these things, meaning they end up determining outcomes even when you don't want them to.

\subsubsection{Should algorithms be transparent?}\label{should-algorithms-be-transparent}}

Some predictive algorithms give us more than just a prediction: they also give us some
insight as to what factor(s) influenced the prediction. Examples you might have encountered in your studies already include linear regression models and classification trees.

Other algorithms yield predictions, but no information about how it got from the inputs
to the prediction, such as neural networks (you may see these in future courses). These are sometimes called `black box' algorithms and many machine learning tools fall into this. We'll briefly talk more about this when we discuss generalized additive models later in the course.

What is more important---getting the most accurate predictions, or understanding the factor(s) which influence a prediction?

When you approach a new statistical problem, try to figure out if you are aiming to make \textbf{predictions}, make \textbf{inferences} about relationships between variables, or provide informative \textbf{summaries and descriptions} of the data.

While the technical skills of U of T statistics graduates are well received by employers. There is a common theme of communication skills not matching their business needs.

This is part of the thinking behind the emphasis on writing in this course, your professional development task and the project, as well as providing opportunities to `talk stats' in Team Up! groups.

The section lays out some overarching tips about how to think about your role as a statistical communicator and some general tips about statistical reports, and their contents and structure.

\subsubsection{What can statisticians learn about communication from Winston Churchill's mother's dinner conversation?}\label{what-can-statisticians-learn-about-communication-from-winston-churchills-mothers-dinner-conversation}}

In the lead up to a British election during the Victorian era, Jennie Jerome (Churchill's mum) attended a dinner with the leader of the Conservatives, Benjamin Disraeli, and the leader of the Liberals, William Ewart Gladstone. She said:

\begin{quote}
``When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman.''
\end{quote}

Who won that election?

\textbf{Disraeli.} \footnote{(Optional) Read more here: \url{https://www.businessinsider.com/charismatic-leadership-tips-from-history-2016-10}}

\textbf{So, what \emph{can} statisticians learn about communication from Winston Churchill's mother's dinner conversation?}

I think of this story often when working with clients. Especially early in my career, while I was still building my confidence, there was always the impulse to `show off' my stats knowledge through jargon in some attempt to show that I was `worth the money' clients were paying.

And sure, you need to have substance and skill to do the job well. But always think of your job when communicating with non-statisticians as additionally one of \textbf{education}.

You want repeat business? Or to impress your non-statistician manager? Then communicate in ways that helps them to `aha!' moments. \textbf{Have them leave you feeling cleverer about statistics than they thought they were coming in.}

\item
  Write ``methods'' section of collaborative papers.\\
\item

You might see this more commonly in business or government contexts.

\hypertarget{introreport}{%
\subsubsection{Introduction}\label{introreport}}

\textbf{Purpose}: provides background information about the project/research.
* Why was the investigation done?
* What research questions are considered in the report (scope)?

The final paragraph of the introduction should outline what is in the rest of the report. Think of it as the road map.

Important: If you are consulting for a client/collaborator \footnote{If you're interested in statistical consulting, STA490 is a great course (I'm biased), though often limited to students in the Methods and Practice Specialist and with very strict prerequisites}, don't pretend to be an expert if you are not one!

\hypertarget{data-summary-optional}{%
\subsubsection{Data summary (optional)}\label{data-summary-optional}}

Useful if you feel you need more details than you can reasonably give in the Introduction and/or what will be discussed in a Methods section.

\textbf{Purpose}: describing the data, but not answering the research question (which you will put in the ``Results'' section).

\textbf{Might include:}
* Basic summary tables, graphs, and descriptive statistics.\\
* Changes made to the data to make it suitable for analysis.\\
* Discussion of decisions around missing data.\\
* Large tables or series of graphs should go in an \emph{appendix}, not in the main body of the report.

\item
  Briefly describe the design of the scientific study, in the context of the analysis.

  \item
    If you're writing for a collaborator, you don't need to tell the collaborator what \emph{they} did. Use this section for what you did!
  \item
    Resist the temptation to make a diary. This shouldn't be a digest of everything you've done (only the key analyses which you wish to comment on in the results section).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Do \textcolor{red}{NOT} include trivial information (e.g., "The data in Excel were saved in a text file and read into R``).
\item
  Be clear which methods were used for what purpose, related to the context of the project. This will likely need to be clarified further in the results section.
\item
  The required level of detail depends on the statistical method.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Basic/standard methods (e.g., t-tests, linear regression): do not need to explain.
  \item
    More advanced methods: explain the general motivating ideas in words; you are not writing a statistics textbook!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A separate methods section is traditional in many scientific journals, but can be difficult (and frustrating) to write if it is too disconnected from the analysis. \emph{Sometimes} it is better to describe the methods and results together.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Make sure this section is clearly organized, point-by-point, in paragraphs.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I would encourage you to consider providing code in `supplementary materials' as this can aid others with reproducing your results and learning from your work. Privacy and sensitivity of data considerations apply.\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Include graphs and small tables that tell the main story; less relevant graphs/tables should go in an appendix.\\
\item
  If you include a figure/table, you must refer to it in the body of the report (NO lonely figures/tables!). Describe in words what the table/graph shows.
\item
  If you find you are repeating all of the information that is in the graph or table, consider whether or not you need the graph or table.
  The purpose of figures and tables is to illustrate a pattern, which should be clear for someone looking at it.
\item
  Figures and tables require clear labels and captions (not too small!).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    General advice/convention is that tables are read from top to bottom, and so \textbf{table captions go on top of the table}. Figures on the other hand are read `bottom to top' and so \textbf{figure captions go below the figure}. If your image is not in a report (i.e.~an info-graphic like our charts from the data exploration assessment) you might prefer to have a clear title (and subtitle) at the top instead of a caption.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  You may want to group similar graphs into a figure with sub-figures (e.g., Fig 1a, 1b ---be sure that the labels/captions are large enough to read though)
\item
  \textbf{Describe results in words} and include, parenthetically, the relevant statistics such as means with standard errors (or confidence intervals) or the test statistic with p-value.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Round appropriately!} What is an interesting or useful level of `granularity' for this study?

\item
  Keep in mind this is \textbf{\emph{not} a dumping ground}. Only include graphs/tables which would be useful/interesting to your audience, and make sure any figures/tables you include there stand alone (e.g., with detailed titles and captions) and are supported by text if necessary.

\item
  The \textbf{ordering} of ideas should be consistent throughout your report.
  E.g., if there are multiple research questions in the introduction, they should be addressed in the same order in the methods, results, and conclusion. This is such a simple thing, but easy to forget in the moment.
\item
  You \emph{could} also combine the methods/results sections and \textbf{organize your report by the question being answered} (with one subsection for each question).

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    In each subsection, state the methods used and the results.
    Having separate sections for methods and results makes more sense if the same methods are used repeatedly.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  placed quotation marks ("") around the verbatim text copied and pasted below, and
\item
  provided a reference in the previous sentence (Provencher, \ldots{} 2018) and the complete citation at the end under ``References''.{]}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
``The annual growth in the number of births in the past five years has fluctuated, compared with the period from 2002/2003 to 2008/2009, when it remained positive and stronger (2.1\% on average). Between 2011 and 2012 and between 2013 and 2014, the number of births rose around 1.0\% across Canada, while they fell 0.4\% from 2012 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2015. There was only a small increase of 0.2\% between 2015 and 2016. Since 2001, the total number of births fell only four times, in 2001/2002 and 2009/2010, and more recently in 2012/2013 and 2014/2015.''

The following provides guidance on what \textbf{poor}, \textbf{adequate} and \textbf{excellent} paraphrasing could look like. You will be putting this into practice with your \protect\hyperlink{portfolio}{portfolio} writing task.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copying/pasting verbatim is NOT paraphrasing.
\item
  In the following, there is no change in structure, just a few words replaced.
\end{itemize}

``The \textcolor{red}{~~annual growth~~} \textcolor{blue}{yearly increase} in the number of births in the \textcolor{red}{~~past~~} \textcolor{blue}{last} five years has \textcolor{red}{~~fluctuated~~} \textcolor{blue}{varied}, compared with in contrast to the period from\ldots{}''

\hypertarget{adequate}{%
\subparagraph{Adequate}\label{adequate}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Changes in wording and structure but text is vague and does not help the reader understand the main points in context of location or time, nor does it provide the source of information.
\end{itemize}

\emph{The number of births has fluctuated over time. There are times when the number is relatively high and sometimes it is relatively low. Not all increases were large with some being as little as 0.2\%\ldots{}}

This is adequate in that it is not obviously an academic integrity offence but it would not be particularly useful.

\hypertarget{excellent}{%
\subparagraph{Excellent}\label{excellent}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Changes in wording and structure. Provides a good overview.
\item
  Conclusion with appropriate hedging: ``\ldots may have been a contributing factor\ldots{}''
\item
  A shorter version without explaining all the points would have been okay too.
\item
  Stating the reason for observation is unknown and may require further inquiry would have been okay too.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Based on the 2018 report provided by Statistics Canada, yearly birth growth in Canada was initially increasing from 2001/2002 up till 2008/2009 but then slowed down. At its peak, yearly birth growth reached nearly 4\% while at its lowest, after 2008/2009, birth growth was even slightly negative at times. The number of births fell 4 times from 2001 to 2016, with 3 out of 4 of these times being in the second half of 2001 -- 2016. All these observations point toward a possible change at that time to disrupt the trends midway in 2008. The timing of the lowering of birth numbers coincides with the 2008 financial crisis in Canada and this may have been a contributing factor as families may have not had the financial certainty to have kids. A close examination of contributing factors through research is needed to see if this is true.}

\hypertarget{how-to-think-about-paraphrasing}{%
\subsubsection{How to think about paraphrasing?}\label{how-to-think-about-paraphrasing}}

Based on a method suggested by (Swales \& Feak, 2012), identify:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  important points from the text,\\
\item
  relationships,\\
\item
  linking phrases,\\
\item
  connectors, and\\
\item
  synonyms.
\end{itemize}

Below is an example of how you might have taken notes on the example paragraph to aid your paraphrasing. You \emph{don't} need to submit anything like this as part of your portfolio assessment. Submit the response to the prompt only. Please be aware that if you do not paraphrase correctly, you may receive a zero on the ENTIRE writing component.

\item
  Number of births has fluctuated in past 5 years.
\item

We will be using R through RStudio to conduct analyses in this course. If you have a local installation of R you are welcome to continue using that, but, for this course, you do not need to have R and RStudio installed. Instead, assessments and activities will be shared through the U of T JupyterHub. This gives you access to RStudio in your browser through your U of T login on any internet-connected device. It means you don't have to fight package installations and we can instead focus on the good stuff.

\textbf{Please read through the following slides, experiment with the example sharing link, make sure you know how to knit an Rmd to pdf + export the pdf, and practice navigating and moving files.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    There is \textbf{no reason to come and lurk}. These sessions are the activity and nothing else.
  \item
    You can easily get marks for your 🧺knowledge basket in SOOO many other ways AND I will make an asynchronous practice version available so you don't miss out on practice.~

\item
  Remember that \textbf{you don't have to participate in Team Up! activities}, there are plenty of other ways to earn your 🧺knowledge basket marks.~

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Only participate if you really are going to participate (see above).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Check you can access \textbf{Shiny interactives} on the JupyterHub: \href{https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fgithub.com\%2Fsta303-bolton\%2Fsta303-w22-activities\&urlpath=shiny\%2Fsta303-w22-activities\%2Finst\%2Ftutorials\%2Fsta303_m1_tests\%2F\&branch=master}{Module 1 interactive}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If you get a `Not Found' error this is most likely due to one of two issues:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Solution 1: Ensure you don't have any other interactives open. (Close any tabs with the orange-arcs JupyterHub logo).
    \item
      Solution 2: Go to \url{https://jupyter.utoronto.ca}, open a new RStudio session by going New -\textgreater{} RStudio (see slide 3 of \href{https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/resources.html\#using-rstudio-with-the-jupyterhub}{these instructions}) and move any .Rmd files in your 🏠Home directory~(see slide 10 of \href{https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/resources.html\#using-rstudio-with-the-jupyterhub}{these instructions}) to a new folder (or delete them if you don't need them). Remember: No naked Rmds in YOUR home!
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Decide if you want to be \textbf{randomized into a group} or \textbf{work with a group of people you already know in the course} (section/tut enrolment doesn't matter).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If \textbf{randomizing}, join the Zoom link for the tutorial time you are attending. `Arrive' on time as latecomers may not be placed in a group.
  \item
    If \textbf{working with your own group}, you don't need to join the call (but can if you get stuck with the tech!). Decide at which time you want to do the activity and set up a personal Zoom/Teams/WeChat/Instagram/carrier pigeon/semaphore chat. Zoom has nothing to do with Team Up!.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Read over the Team Up! instructions below.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{some-ruleslogistics}{%
\subsection{Some rules/logistics}\label{some-ruleslogistics}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Speak up!} Practice talking about statistics. For these activities, I'd honestly rather you be wrong out loud than right in silence.
\item
  \textbf{Be kind} and constructive. You are in a team, practice being a good team member.
\item
  Team Up! does not have a great back end. If you don't submit correctly or don't join a group correctly, I CANNOT go in and check or move you around. \textbf{FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No accommodations will be made for Team Up! issues. Team Up! marks will not be updated by hand (e.g., if you end up in a solo group/tech issues, etc.).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  You must do this as a group activity, during a tutorial time, if you wish to receive a 🧺knowledge basket grade.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{A `group' is 2--4 people.}
  \item
    All members of groups of 1 (solos) and 5+ will receive a zero. Group size is based on what is \textbf{recorded by Team Up!} through your registration with your group codes.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  You cannot do a Team Up! more than once.~ You cannot attend both sessions.
\item
  If you have a ghost 👻in your room (randomized in the class organized Zoom call), please `Ask for help' (there is a button). `Raise hand' \emph{doesn't} alert me if you're in a breakout room.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Timing note: Assessment pages will become available at 15 minutes past the hour and remain available for 45 minutes. Ensure sure your team submits by the end of the session.}

\hypertarget{team-up-instructions}{%
\subsection{Team Up! Instructions}\label{team-up-instructions}}

Participating in Team Up! activities can earn you knowledge basket points. They will be based on how well your team does, so work together and give it a good effort.

You will complete the following 5 steps:
.midi{[}
1. \textbf{Introductions} (first/personal name + a one-word description of how your week is going so far). Use this time to confirm everyone understands the instructions.
2. \textbf{Driver} sets up Team Up! group
3. \textbf{Members} join Team Up! group
4. Complete the activity
5. \textbf{Submit} the activity

\hypertarget{step-1-decide-on-roles}{%
\subsubsection{Step 1: Decide on roles}\label{step-1-decide-on-roles}}

You will need:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An \textbf{Instructions Master} who is responsible for helping the team follow these instructions carefully.\\
\item
  A \textbf{Screensharer} who is responsible for sharing the activity on their screen.
\item
  A \textbf{Driver} for the Team Up! side of the activity. The Driver acts as team leader, responsible for navigating the quiz,~confirming~the team's final agreed upon answer to a question, and submitting the completed quiz~score~to Quercus.The Driver has a steering wheel next to their ID and is differently coloured than other Team Members.
\end{itemize}

Team Members (other than the Driver) participate and choose vote on answers, so all team mates can see what they have chosen, but they cannot submit their choices to Team Up!.

DECIDE THIS BEFORE CLICKING ANYTHING TO DO WITH TEAM UP!

\hypertarget{step-2-driver-sets-up-group}{%
\subsubsection{Step 2: Driver sets up group}\label{step-2-driver-sets-up-group}}

The person in your group whose first/personal name comes last alphabetically will be the Leader (Driver) for the session.

\textbf{The Driver must do the below steps FIRST to get the group code.} Then they will share the group code with all the members of the group so they can also join.

1 Log-in to Quercus from your device (phone, tablet, computer).

1 Click on the Team Up! assignment from the \href{https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253305/pages/course-overview}{Course Overview} page.

2 Click `Go to Tool'. If it is not appearing, refresh your page or try a different browser.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/course-tools/gototool} \end{center}

NON-DRIVERS! DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

3 Choose ``Create New Group''

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/course-tools/choose create} \end{center}

4 Share group ID in Zoom

\subsubsection{Step 4: Complete the activity}\label{step-4-complete-the-activity}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  You will need to have the \textbf{interactive activity (question document)} associated with this task open on to see the answer options and update any code. \textbf{Be prepared to switch between Team Up! and the JupyterHub tab.}
\item
  The Driver chooses a question, and the team can participate by choosing their own answers and discussing their choices with each other. Once the team decides on a final answer, the driver chooses it and clicks the Check Answer button. \textbf{Note}: The Driver can check an answer despite what the team members choose, so be careful that you have consensus before clicking the Check Answer button. You cannot undo.
\item
  If the answer is \textbf{correct}, you will be awarded the full score or ``diamonds'' for that question. You will be able to proceed onward by clicking the Next button that will appear under the Check Answer button or by clicking on a question in the menu on the left. If your team's answer is \textbf{not correct}, discuss the question and choose again. Repeat until you get the correct answer. All teammates can see whether responses are correct/incorrect as well as their team's overall score as they progress through the Team Up! session.

\subsection{What to do if you experience technical difficulties during class?}\label{what-to-do-if-you-experience-technical-difficulties-during-class}}

\textbf{First}, (if possible) send me a chat note that you're having technical difficulties and are working to resolve them.

\textbf{Second}, leave the meeting and re-enter. This often resets things and resolves the problem. Before entering the meeting, make sure all of your devices are properly plugged in and Bluetooth devices are connected.

If that doesn't fix things, exit the meeting again and update your Zoom Client. This is the Zoom software that should be on your computer. Here's a short video tutorial explaining how to update the software: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7zERcVLUBM}.

After updating, enter the meeting again to see if this resolved your problems.

\textbf{Our synchronous classes are recorded, so if your technology is just going catastrophically wrong, go get a cup of tea/coffee/water and relax, you can catch up with the recording when it is posted on Quercus.}

\subsection{What to do if your instructor or TA is experiencing technical difficulties on Zoom}\label{what-to-do-if-your-instructor-or-ta-is-experiencing-technical-difficulties-on-zoom}}

\textbf{First,} check the \textbf{chat} to see if the instructor or the project mentor have said what is going on and what they are doing to fix things and follow any instructions they give.

\textbf{Second}, if they have disappeared completely, wait 10 minutes (or until the end of the meeting time, whichever comes first) before closing the call. (You can do other things in the meantime, but be ready to jump back in).

\textbf{Third}, expect to see an announcement on Quercus afterwards telling you what to do (e.g.~it might be to watch a video I'll record later, to review some slides or perhaps there is nothing to do and i'll see you next time).

\textbf{Wednesdays}: 1st part is (recorded) content/demo and the second is office hour (unrecorded). Aiming for half-half, but will vary.

\textbf{Thursdays}: The 1st Thursday of a module will have a Team Up! or other practice activity. This will also be made available asynchronously, but the knowledge basket points for a Team Up! can only be earned by \textbf{synchronous, group participation}. The 2nd Thursday will be drop-in TA office hours to get help on content and assessments.

Thursday sessions are not recorded, but the Team Up! or other activities content will be made available to everyone. There are several other ways to earn your knowledge basket points if this doesn't suit your tech setup (e.g.~no mic) or time zone.

Yes!*

*If the number of attendees is getting too close to the call cap of 300 (this is a Zoom license thing), preference will be given to those enrolled in the session and others will be asked to leave. Any Team Up! activity bonuses will also be applied---section/session does not matter.

The knowledge basket maxes out at 5\%, otherwise I get in trouble for giving away too many ``free'' points. (I know, I wish.)

\hypertarget{can-we-do-as-many-knowledge-basket-activities-as-we-want-in-order-to-gain-the-full-5}{%

Yes! But do try to plan ahead, as I won't be adding a bunch of make-up opportunities at the end\ldots part of the goal is to incentivize personalized, regular participation in the course to create the best learning outcomes for you.

\hypertarget{how-fast-will-we-receive-grades-back-for-the-knowledge-basket-activities}{%

It will depend, but many should be fairly quick---a few days if autograded/based on completion. 1--2 weeks for professional development proposal and evidence \& reflection.

\hypertarget{i-am-not-too-sure-what-pre-knowledge-quiz-80-or-workshop-is-supposed-to-mean.}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{``I am not too sure what `pre-knowledge quiz: 80\% or workshop' is supposed to mean.''}}{``I am not too sure what `pre-knowledge quiz: 80\% or workshop' is supposed to mean.''}}\label{i-am-not-too-sure-what-pre-knowledge-quiz-80-or-workshop-is-supposed-to-mean.}}

If you score 80\% or more on the pre-knowledge check, you automatically get 0.5\% for doing it + 0.5\% for a high score. If you do the check but get less than 80\% you get 0.5\% for completion, and can still get that additional 0.5\% if you come participate in the workshop.

Workshop open to all. And you don't have to go if you have other plan for filling your basket. It is meant to be helpful to you, though.

And no, you can't get the workshop AND 80\%+ points. One or the other for a max of 1\%.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{``What will additional opportunities like speaker series reflections be like?''}}{``What will additional opportunities like speaker series reflections be like?''}}\label{what-will-additional-opportunities-like-speaker-series-reflections-be-like}}

May vary depending on the speaker/workshop, but for next week (grad panel) it will likely be attendance + a short Quercus survey. Just confirming a few things still so, TBA. (Watch for more details in announcements.)

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{``Are the three phases of each writing assignment graded on completion?''}}{``Are the three phases of each writing assignment graded on completion?''}}\label{are-the-three-phases-of-each-writing-assignment-graded-on-completion}}

Yes, but see caveats \href{https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/knowledge-basket-writing-and-peer-feedback.html\#general-instructions}{here in the general instructions for the writing tasks.}

If you don't want lots of little deadlines, you don't have to have lots of little deadlines! Do the professional development tasks + a few Team Ups! or the professional development task + punctuation art. Throw in the pre-knowledge check and you're looking great!

2022-01-12: \textbf{More info over the next two weeks}, but these will be a lot like a traditional assignment, but with a writing task (the module writing tasks are good indicators and practice) and some additional narrative about what you're learning/demonstrating. You'll submit commented code in an Rmd and the associated PDF.

\hypertarget{mixed-assessments-faq}{%

Mostly, except there will also be a small amount of pre-work. More information closer too, but the overall goal is to make it more real-world. When you prep for a big meeting in the real world, you might calculate some summary stats, have a few basic plots ready, have some notes, etc. Sure, there are some things where you'll have to think it through in the moment (in the mixed assessment and in the real world), but I hope having the untimed pre-work helps lessen some of the test anxiety folks can feel. Less mind reading, more targeted prep.

\hypertarget{whats-the-difference-between-mini-and-mixed-assessments-are-they-both-term-tests}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{``What's the difference between mini and mixed assessments? Are they both term tests?''}}{``What's the difference between mini and mixed assessments? Are they both term tests?''}}\label{whats-the-difference-between-mini-and-mixed-assessments-are-they-both-term-tests}}

One is bigger and one is smaller. ;) But yeah, the mini has one 50 minute timed component while the main mixed assessment will have more pre-work and two 50 minute timed parts.

\hypertarget{will-we-get-some-sample-practice-problems-to-work-on-before-the-mini-mixed-and-mixed-assessments}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Will we get some sample practice problems to work on before the mini-mixed and mixed assessments?}}{Will we get some sample practice problems to work on before the mini-mixed and mixed assessments?}}\label{will-we-get-some-sample-practice-problems-to-work-on-before-the-mini-mixed-and-mixed-assessments}}

The `mini' is effectively practice problems for the main, but Team Up!s will also be useful practice for the mixed assessments. If there isn't a Team Up! (which you've be able to review asynchronously for study purposes) for a module I'll offer a practice quiz (no points) option or other practice activity.

\hypertarget{what-exactly-will-we-do-in-assessment-weeks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{``What exactly will we do in assessment weeks?''}}{``What exactly will we do in assessment weeks?''}}\label{what-exactly-will-we-do-in-assessment-weeks}}

There is \textbf{no new content or writing module}. They are a time to focus your 6--8 hours of weekly STA303 time on the assessment. \textbf{Mixed:} doing the pre-work and the 100 minute (2 x 50) timed component. \textbf{Project week:} working with your group/self, asking questions in office hours. The expectation is that you'll start the project well before then, but I know the end of the semester can be stressful and busy, so I'm making things as simple and focused for you as I can.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{``So are all assessment due on Thursday 3:03?''}}{``So are all assessment due on Thursday 3:03?''}}\label{so-are-all-assessment-due-on-thursday-303}}

Almost all the big ones! The mixed assessments have a window, but professional development proposal, professional development evidence \& reflection, mini-portfolio, portfolio and project are all due on a Thursday at 3:03 p.m.

This is an R-based course, so only coding assessments using R will be accepted. (Note: For the professional development task ONLY you could use another language in a blog post/write-up etc., as we are grading your goal-setting and reflection on a communication/collaboration task, not your code directly.)

As long as you are logged in, you will receive your grade, so just continue to participate by communicating with your team.

\subsubsection{Some true things about matrices}\label{some-true-things-about-matrices}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{rank} of a matrix is the number of linearly independent columns your matrix has.\\
\item
  If the number of columns = the rank of the matrix all the columns are \textbf{linearly independent}. If the umber of columns is \textgreater{} the rank of the matrix, all the columns are \emph{not} linearly independent.\\
\item
  You can only \textbf{invert} a square matrix if all its columns are linearly independent. (Determinant non-zero).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why do we care?} In linear regression, to estimate \(\boldsymbol\beta\), our vector of coefficients, we calculate \((\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol X)^{-1}\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol Y\). The elements of \(\boldsymbol\beta\) can't be estimated if \(\boldsymbol X^T\boldsymbol X\) (a square matrix) isn't invertible.

Clarification to what I said in the tests activity: We usually perform regression with an intercept because we don't want to assume out line passes through the origin, \textbf{0}. So, if there is an intercept, (column of 1s in the model matrix) we must convert every categorical variable with \(k\) levels into \(k-1\) dummy variables to have the intercept and still satisfies linear independence. IF we ditch the intercept, we can have k dummies, but this is only usually useful in the specific case of ANOVA.

As I said at the beginning, I'm not planning to assess you on any of this. If you're interested in knowing more, or just think matrix algebra is delicious, I think this is a delightfully approachable walk through. \url{https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/132/}

\section{P-values (recap)}\label{p-values-recap}}

Remember: ``Small but mighty!'' The \emph{smaller} the p-value, the \emph{stronger} the evidence against the null hypothesis.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We should never be making claims in in favour/against the alternative hypothesis. Our \emph{statistical} claims are always about the null. This may inform practical decisions in less strict ways, depending on practical significance, risks, etc., but a correct statistical claim for a p-value should ALWAYS be about the null. Absolutes are rare in teaching statistics.\\
\item
  A common threshold for rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis is 0.05. This is mostly from habit/convention, rather than some truly meaningful cosmic value. ``Yeah, 1 in 20? Unlikely, sure.'' Difference disciplines/sub-disciplines develop norms appropriate to their context.
\item
  Many statisticians---especially in light of the reproducibilty crisis and poor public, and even sometimes researcher, understanding of p-values---prefer to make statements about the \textbf{strength} of evidence, not just reject/fail to reject.

\subsection{What if you get a value that is exactly one of these thresholds?}\label{what-if-you-get-a-value-that-is-exactly-one-of-these-thresholds}}

It would be very rare to get a p-value of exactly one of these thresholds. If you were to, you could decide based on your judgment of the context. Should you be more or less conservative in your interpretation based on the needs of the project/client?

So, you'll almost always have something, that while it may round to 0.001 (or another threshold), is really something like 0.001345789 or 0.00098963. What judgment would you make in each case, with this in mind?

But remember, these are \textbf{fuzzy boundaries based on easy-to-grasp probabilities for humans}, particularly humans used to thinking in base 10. 1 in 20, 1 in 100, 1 in 1000, etc. Easy to think about but not universally meaningful thresholds. Honestly, being a little over or under really doesn't make that much of a difference. P-values are continuous random variables. We impose discrete categories for our own ease. Used too rigidly, these guidelines have the same problem as rejecting/failing to reject, but just with a few more levels.

The volunteer notetaking program is one of the most commonly used resources provided to students registered with Accessibility Services. Here at the University of Toronto, the accessibility office is seeking dependable volunteer note-takers to assist students living with a disability to achieve academic success.

Volunteers report that by giving back to the U of T community, their class attendance and notetaking skills improve.

To become a volunteer notetaker, all you must do is attend classes regularly \& submit/upload your notes consistently/weekly. Volunteers can receive co-curricular credit(s) and/or a certificate of appreciation and/or be eligible for year-end prize draws.

\underline{To become a volunteer note-taker, please follow these 4 steps}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Register Online as a Volunteer Note-Taker at: \url{https://clockwork.studentlife.utoronto.ca/custom/misc/home.aspx}
\item
  Click on Volunteer Notetakers, and sign in using your UTORid.
\item
  Select the course(s) you wish to take notes for.~Please note:~you do NOT need to upload sample notes or be selected as a volunteer to begin uploading your notes.
\item
  Start uploading notes.
\end{enumerate}

Email us at~\href{mailto:as.notetaking@utoronto.ca}{\nolinkurl{as.notetaking@utoronto.ca}}~if you have questions or require any assistance with uploading notes. If you are no longer able to upload notes for a course, please also let us know immediately. For more information about the Accessibility Services Peer Notetaking program, please visit~\href{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/program/volunteer-note-taking}{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/program/volunteer-note-taking/}{]}. Thank you for your support and for making notes more accessible for our students.\\

\subsection{Looking for student representatives for STA303}\label{studentrep}}

Our course is part of a small pilot of student representative pilot for the Department of Statistical Sciences and I am looking for two undergraduate student representatives to work with me to represent our course. (STA1002 students, there isn't a grad version of this, but you can also provide feedback to these reps and I encourage you to also reach out to me directly!)

Student representatives work with their instructor to solicit and respond to student feedback throughout the semester. Representatives talk with their instructors about how the course is going, provide feedback to the department about student needs more generally and learn about department resources so that they can help connect students to these, as relevant.

You can learn more about the experience from previous reps \href{https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/news/new-pilot-program-enhances-academic-experience-giving-students-voice}{here}.

\hypertarget{the-role-of-a-student-representative}{%
\subsubsection{The role of a student representative}\label{the-role-of-a-student-representative}}

Once a rep is selected, they will:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Attend a mandatory training session.
\item
  Have their email made available to the class on Quercus~so students can contact them.~They may also introduce themselves in a synchronous class, or write a small blurb for an announcement or create a pre-recorded video. This is up to the student/instructor team.
\item
  Reach out to students to elicit feedback. Additional~tasks~(e.g.,~helping with optional student pulse surveys or organising study groups or class events, etc.)~would be~left to the discretion of the student representative and~instructor (they are \emph{not} a required part of the program).~~
\item
  Keep in regular contact with the instructor as issues or concerns~arise.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{benefits-of-being-a-student-representative}{%
\subsubsection{Benefits of being a student representative}\label{benefits-of-being-a-student-representative}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Being part of creating a great learning experience for themselves and others.
\item
  Networking with other students and members of the Department.
\item
  Opportunities to work closely with an instructor that may mean they could be a strong referee for you and/or lead to taking a reading course with them etc.
\item
  A chance to demonstrate and improve communication, leadership,~and organisational skills.
\item
  Something to put on a CV.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-to-become-a-rep}{%
\subsubsection{How to become a rep}\label{how-to-become-a-rep}}

\textbf{If you are eligible (see below), you can~put yourself forward via~\href{https://forms.office.com/r/3ZjP0TBpQd}{this form}.} Please make sure you choose the correct section, where applicable! Student representatives for each section will be selected via lottery from the eligible students that have expressed interest by Monday, January 24 at 6:00 p.m. ET.~~

\hypertarget{eligibility-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Eligibility criteria}\label{eligibility-criteria}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  You will need to be available to attend an online training, 11:10 a.m.--12:00 p.m. ET on Friday, 28 January 2022.
\item
  You must be enrolled in the section you put yourself forward for.
\item
  You \emph{don't} have to be enrolled in a DoSS program to put yourself forward for the role, though it may be of more interest/use to you if you are.
