University of Toronto, Department of Statistical Sciences STA303/1002: Methods of Data Analysis II 2.1 Course information 2022 HALF YEAR, HALF CREDIT 2.1.1 Course description The course focuses on using and interpreting advanced statistical methods with applications in a number of different areas. The overall theme of this course is dealing with situations where the assumptions of the regression models developed in STA302 may not apply. The course is a mixture of theory and application. Assignments will involve computing with R and there is a significant focus on written and oral communication. 2.1.2 Class times Class: Wednesdays L0101: 10:00 a.m.‚Äî12:00 p.m. ET L0201: 3:00 p.m.‚Äî5:00 p.m. ET Tutorials: Alternating Thursdays 12:00 p.m.‚Äî1:00 p.m. ET or 5:00 p.m.‚Äî6:00 p.m. ET Delivery Wednesday classes will be online and recorded. The Thursday tutorial time will alternate between group activities and TA office hours. They will be online for January, and an optional in-person stream for the fortnightly group activities is planned after that. Synchronous attendance is recommended but not required to complete the course. 2.1.3 Materials All materials will be posted on Quercus and/or the course guide. Course discussion board: Piazza 2.1.4 Teaching team 2.1.4.1 Instructor Liza Bolton Pronouns: she/her Email: sta303@utoronto.ca Office hours: 2nd half of Wednesday classes Please call me: Liza or Prof. Bolton/Prof. B How do you pronounce that? Liza: a video‚Ä¶ Bolton: like the words ‚Äúbowl‚Äù + ‚Äútonne‚Äù 2.1.4.2 Head TA Amin Banihashemi (he/him) Please call me: Amin (A-meen [√¶ÀàmiÀên or …ôÀàmiÀên] [b√¶niÀêÀàh…ëÀê É…õmiÀê] decode here) Email: sta303@utoronto.ca 2.1.4.3 Teaching assistants Vedant Choudhary, Shuang Di, Sonia Markes, Ian Richter, Xiaochuan Shi, Lei Sun, Liam Welsh, Dongyang Yang, Kevin Zhang, Robert Zimmerman Office hours: Alternating Thursdays, see Quercus Email: sta303@utoronto.ca 2.2 Land acknowledgment The land on which our University operates is the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. With the Dish With One Spoon treaty, these peoples agreed to share and protect this land, and all those who have come here since, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, are invited into this treaty in a spirit of respect and peace. This land is also, more recently, subject to Treaty 13, a treaty between the Mississaugas and the British Crown. In this course, we are coming together to discuss statistics, a field that has been part of historical and ongoing colonization, oppression, and harm of Indigenous peoples. Let us remind ourselves of our responsibilities to this land, its original peoples, and to each other and work to be ethical and culturally competent practitioners in our chosen fields. We encourage you to consider the history of the land wherever you are. https://www.whose.land/en/ 2.3 Prerequisites STA302/1001 I.e., we will assume that you are familiar with running linear regression analyses, including checking assumptions and some of the mathematical reasoning behind the models. Material from the second-year statistical theory courses which are prerequisites to STA302 will be drawn on extensively. Knowledge of programming with R is essential. 2.4 Course format and organization This course is composed of five two-week modules and two assessment focus weeks. Each module has an ‚ÄúI show you, you show me‚Äù structure. It starts with you watching videos and/or doing readings and a guided code demonstration or other relevant class topics (‚ÄúI show you‚Äù). This course is flipped, so the expectation is that you engage with some or all of the asynchronous content before Wednesday in the first week. Then you will do some or all of the following: a group problem-solving activity, practice quizzes, assessment activities. During assessment focus weeks, no new content will be released. 2.5 Learning objectives By the end of the course, you will be able to: Wrangle and explore a dataset Create appropriate data visualizations Describe ethical considerations in data analysis Understand the assumptions and appropriate use cases for linear mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models, and generalized additive models Write and execute R code for the model types covered Accurately and appropriately interpret the results of the model types covered and communicate these to a range of audiences 2.6 Textbooks You do not have to purchase a textbook for this course. There are three texts that we will use extensively, and they are all freely available to you. Additional readings will be assigned as appropriate. Wickham. R for Data Science. 2019. Legler and Roback. Broadening Your Statistical Horizons. 2019. Wood. Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R, 2nd Edition. 2017. (requires you to log in with your UTORid) 2.7 Computing and minimum technical requirements We will be using RStudio to make reproducible data analysis reports using R and R Markdown. You can use RStudio on your personal machine or through the U of T JupyterHub: jupyter.utoronto.ca. To participate in synchronous classes and office hours you will need a U of T Zoom account. If you do not yet have one, go to https://utoronto.zoom.us/ to set one up. To participate fully, you will need Desktop client or mobile app: version 5.3.0 or higher or ChromeOS: version 5.0.0 (4241.1207) or higher. You can check your desktop client or mobile app version by following these instructions. All students should consult the minimum technical requirements for participation in online learning. If you are facing financial barriers to obtaining the required technology, please contact your College Registrar‚Äôs Office to obtain information regarding your potential eligibility for a need-based bursary. 2.8 Course outline The topics listed below are subject to change.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood1: You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark. I will calculate your marks along both paths and then assign you the higher of the two as your final mark. (Grad students have a third option) A-tisket, a-tasket2, fill up your knowledge basket3: Personalize which of these assessments you do based on your interests and skills you want to develop. You can ‚Äòmax out‚Äô your basket: just keep putting grades in until you get to 10% (Path A) or 5% (Path B). Assessment Path A Path B STA1002 ONLY Due dates Mini-portfolio 5 0 0 Feb 3 Portfolio 20 25 25 Feb 7 Mini-mixed assessment 5 0 0 Mar 9 (12-hour assessment window, 8:00 a.m.‚Äì8:00 p.m. ET) Mixed assessment 20 25 25 Mar 16 (12-hour assessment window, 8:00 a.m.‚Äì8:00 p.m. ET) Final project 45 45 50 Apr 7 (2% pt bonus) | Apr 11 (no bonus) Knowledge basket 5 5 0 Multiple Total 100 100 100 Everything4 in STA303 is due at 3:03 p.m. ET Note: All times in this course are in Eastern Time (Toronto time). Please note that daylight savings will begin in Canada on March 13. If you are not based in Canada this may change the time conversion for you. Please keep this in mind. 2.9.1 Knowledge basket The following components are guaranteed knowledge basket assessment options. Additional opportunities may be offered throughout the course (Team Up!, speaker series reflections, etc.) Assessment % Due date Pre-knowledge check: completion 0.5 Jan 20 Pre-knowledge check: 80%+ or workshop 0.5 Jan 20 (80%+ score) | Feb 2 (workshop) Professional development task proposal 1 Feb 3 Professional development task evidence &amp; reflection 3 Mar 31 Writing &amp; peer review (Create-Assess-Reflect) x 5 0.5 X 5 Friday-Tuesday-Friday each Module Module check-in x 5 0.1 X 5 Last Friday of each Module 2.10 Hours expectations While everyone has different work styles and learning needs, I want to provide some guidance around how I expect this course to look for you. Plan to be doing 6‚Äì8 hours of work on STA303 each week. In a two-week module, this may look like: 2‚Äì4 hours on videos and readings 1‚Äì3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities 1‚Äì2 hours on knowledge basket assessments 2‚Äì6 hours on other assessments Remaining time attending reading announcements, office hours, checking Piazza, revision, etc. 2.11 Marking concerns / regrade requests Any request to have an assessment remarked must be submitted to the appropriate form on the Forms page on Quercus under the following conditions: Wait 24 hours after the release of grades. Use this time to go over any sample solutions and feedback, the instructions, and relevant course materials. After the 24-hour period has finished, you will have one week to submit your regrade request. (I.e., one week + 24 hours total.) Your request must include a detailed and thoughtful justification referring to your answer and the relevant course material to be considered. Please note that I reserve the right to review the grading of all questions or parts when you re-submit an assessment for reconsideration (i.e., your grade could go down). You will receive a confirmation email upon submitting the form. Allow for two weeks for processing after the request window closes before following up. The specific timeline and requirements for final project regrade requests will be announced later. Only answers in English (or appropriate code, mathematical symbols) can be accepted in this course. Answers submitted in a different language will receive a 0 and will not be eligible for regrading. If you have an autotranslation extension on your browser, be very careful about how this can interact with Quercus. Please note that I reserve the right to review the grading of all questions or parts when you re-submit an assessment for reconsideration (i.e., your grade could go down). 2.12 Missed work policies In general, late work is not accepted, without either: an extension requested 48 hours before the due date, or a personal illness/emergency declaration no more than 3 days after the due date. Please note that technical difficulties knitting an Rmd or getting the due time wrong do not constitute personal emergencies. The following assessments are eligible: Mini-portfolio Portfolio Mini-mixed assessment Mixed assessment Professional development proposal Professional development evidence and reflection Upon receipt of your request, we will contact you via email within 2 business days to confirm an accommodation, as appropriate. 2.12.1 Exceptions Knowledge basket assessments (other than the professional development task components) are not eligible for extensions. There are no routine extensions granted for the final project. In exceptional circumstances, you can work with your College Registrar and me on this. 2.12.2 IMPORTANT NOTES If too much work is missed, even for valid reasons, an oral exam may be required to calculate a fair mark, at the discretion of the instructor. Please ensure you and/or your College Registrar get in touch with me as early as possible if this may be the case for you. If you have accommodation letters from an accessibility advisor, make sure you read the instructions in the ‚ÄòAccommodations and accessibility‚Äô section. Unless discussed with your instructor first and an agreement is come to, if you submit an assessment, it will be assumed that you deemed yourself fit enough to do so and your grade will stand as calculated. No accommodation will be made based on claims of medical, physical, or emotional distress after the fact. 2.13 Communication policy AKA How to get your questions answered Following our course communication policy helps ensure you receive answers and supports in a timely fashion, and also shows respect for the teaching team‚Äôs time and effort. We reserve the right to ignore any correspondence that does not conform to this policy. Course logistics? e.g., - What is the deadline for the final project? - Where do I submit the assignment? Course content? e.g., - Why do we sometimes use glm() and sometimes use glmer()? - My code won‚Äôt run for question #1 Info to share with class? e.g., - I have a link/resource/opportunity to share with my classmates PIAZZA FORUM Link in Quercus‚Äô course navigation menu. Posts can be anonymous for your classmates, but instructors and TAs will be able to see your name. Before posting a question, double-check the syllabus AND search to see if someone else has already asked a similar question (you can edit the question to add yours or post a follow-up at the bottom). - Try to answer your classmates‚Äô questions‚Äîthis is a great way to reinforce your own understanding while also helping your classmates! Don‚Äôt worry if you aren‚Äôt 100% sure of the answer‚Äîanswers will be reviewed/endorsed/completed by the teaching team! Missed an assessment due to illness or personal emergency? Want to request a regrade of an assessment? FORMS Use the appropriate form linked on the Forms page on Quercus. If you cannot meet a deadline because you are ill, please also refer to the Missed Work section in this syllabus. A doctor‚Äôs note is not required, but if you have one you can upload it as supporting documentation. If you wish to request a regrade, please also refer to the Marking Concerns section in this syllabus. Be prepared to provide a detailed justification and possible supplementary materials. ‚ÄúI worked hard on this so I should get a better mark‚Äù is not an appropriate justification (yes, I do receive emails like that). Personal/sensitive circumstances? (i.e., something which is not appropriate to share with the whole class) COURSE EMAIL: sta303@utoronto.ca Send emails from your utoronto.ca email address to ensure they don‚Äôt automatically go to a Junk folder. Include your full name and UTORid. This account will be monitored by the head TA and course instructor; if you want to reach Prof. Bolton only please include [Prof. Bolton] in the subject line; do not email her directly about course matters. Allow at least 24 hours for a response during the week (Monday to Friday, ET) and do not expect responses on the weekend. Do not send a follow-up email until at least two business days (Toronto time) later. NEVER send Quercus mail to the STA303 teaching team. NEVER use the ‚ÄòAdd Comment‚Äô option on Quercus. They will not read. Please.  2.14 Accommodations and accessibility If you have an accommodation letter from your accessibility advisor that is relevant to this course, please do the following: Email your letter to sta303@utoronto.ca with ‚ÄúAccommodation letter‚Äù as part of the email subject, CC your advisor and let us know anything else you wish us to know/any questions you have. Please do this as soon as possible after you enroll in the course/receive this syllabus. Confirm any accommodations for each specific assessment one week before the assessment. (I.e., if you receive extra time for timed assessments, confirm this one week prior to the mixed assessments, even if we have already discussed this at the beginning of the semester.) 2.14.1 Accessibility services The University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations for a disability or have any accessibility concerns about the course or course materials, please contact Accessibility Services as soon as possible: email accessibility.services@utoronto.ca or visit the website at &lt;http://accessibility.utoronto.ca&gt;. 2.14.2 Religious Accommodation At the University of Toronto, we are part of a diverse community of students, staff, and faculty from a wide range of cultural and religious traditions. For this course, I have sought to avoid scheduling compulsory activities in ways that will clash with religious holy days (not captured by statutory holidays). If you anticipate missing a course activity due to a religious observance, please let me know as early in the course as possible. With sufficient notice‚Äîideally at least three weeks‚Äîwe can work together to make alternate arrangements. 2.15 Recognized study groups I would highly recommend you get involved with an RSG. RSGs are small study groups of 3 to 6 students from the same course who meet weekly to learn course content in a collaborative environment. 2.16 Meet to complete Meet to Complete is an online ‚Äústudy with me‚Äù space where you can study alongside other students. To join Meet to Complete, enroll in the Meet to Complete course on Quercus. Learning, even online, doesn‚Äôt need to be lonely! 2.17 Feeling distressed? You may find yourself feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or anxious. Lots of people feel the same way. There is help available from mental health professionals 24 hours a day via online and phone-based services listed on this page in the course guide, as well as a range of other helpful U of T and community resources. Accessibility Services (see above) also provides supports for mental health concerns. 2.18 Intellectual property statement Course material that has been created by your instructor (i.e., lecture slides, questions/solutions, and any other course material and resources made available to you) is the intellectual property of your instructor (or the credited holder of the copyright) and is made available to you for your personal use in this course. Sharing, posting, selling or using this material outside of your personal use in this course is not permitted under any circumstances and is considered an infringement of intellectual property rights. If you would like to record any course activities in this course, you MUST ask permission from your instructor in advance. According to intellectual property laws, not asking permission constitutes stealing. 2.19 Academic integrity 2.19.1 Plagiarism You may be at risk of plagiarizing if you do not understand the rules and your responsibilities. You must not present the work of others as your own. This includes, but is certainly not limited to, copying text and including it in your writing without a citation and quotation marks. There are many resources to help you learn more: https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/perils-and-pitfalls/ https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/smart-strategies/ This video will be assigned later in the course. YOU are responsible for knowing the content of the University of Toronto‚Äôs Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. The University of Toronto treats cases of academic misconduct very seriously. Academic integrity is a fundamental value of learning and scholarship at the U of T. Participating honestly, respectfully, responsibly, and fairly in this academic community ensures that your U of T degree is valued and respected as a true signifier of your individual academic achievement. Other potential offences include, but are not limited to: Looking at someone else‚Äôs answers. Letting someone else look at your answers. Misrepresenting your identity. Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University. Falsifying institutional documents or grades. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following the procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please do not hesitate to contact me. 2.19.2 Specific advice on untimed assessments As a general rule, for untimed assessments, I encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice. However, it is not permitted to share R code or written answers for anything that is to be handed in. For example, ‚ÄúFor question 2 what R function did you use?‚Äù is a fair question when discussing course material with others in the class; ‚ÄúPlease show me your R code for question 2‚Äù is not an appropriate question. If writing or code is discovered to match another student‚Äôs submission or outside source, this will be reported as an academic offense. When asked to hand in code and the output it creates, the code you submit must have been used to generate the document. If it does not (i.e., the submitted code does not match the submitted output), this is also considered an academic offense. 2.19.3 Rules for timed assessments (e.g., mixed assessments) While all timed assessments in this course are open-book, they are not ‚Äúopen-person.‚Äù You MUST NOT discuss any details of the assessment with anyone else during the assessment window, regardless of your completion status. This includes, but is not limited to, current classmates, friends, and tutors. For example, even asking someone ‚Äúwhich slide did you look at to answer question 3‚Äù is not appropriate for timed assessments. 2.19.4 NOTE: BE CAREFUL ABOUT PRIVATE TUTORING COMPANIES You may have been contacted by private tutoring companies trying to sell their services to you for statistics courses. Please be extremely careful with these services as some forms of tutoring can pose an academic offence risk. A good tutor helps you understand the subject area and supports your learning. A good tutor does not give you answers. There are no shortcuts to learning. Learning takes time and effort. Be cautious about giving money to companies whose motivation is profit. They may tell you they have ‚Äòinsider information.‚Äô They don‚Äôt. They may even offer you the opportunity to commit academic offenses. Please do not put your University of Toronto education at risk by participating in these kinds of unacceptable behaviours. If you have any questions or concerns about what is okay and what is not in your course, please ask! 2.20 Course design principles Here are some of the principles around which I have designed this course. I hope they might provide some useful insight into why some things are the way they are, and help you think about how to navigate this course and make the best of it. The teaching team really wants you to have a great time in this course, learn lots of delicious statistics, and become confident, competent, and useful statistical thinkers. Please approach us and this course with an open mind and help us make it a good experience for you by providing thoughtful, constructive feedback. 2.20.1 Humans learn better ‚Äòlittle and often‚Äô but everyone is burnout from two years of a pandemic I know some students absolutely hate weekly tasks and how common they have become with online learning, and that all the little tasks and deadlines can become overwhelming. I also know that cramming is the absolute worst way to learn and actually retain that learning. This is why in this course: I have taken things out or made them baskets options, based on student feedback There is a knowledge basket that lets you approach frequent low-stakes practice in the way that suits you best and aims to facilitate and reward spaced repetition, the way science says is the best way to learn (this free course is fantastic for learning more about how to learn). Has been converted to have a two-week module structure to give you more flexibility. Has two assessments pathways with different numbers of assessments. 2.20.2 Writing is good for statisticians Writing not only helps you explain yourself to others, it can also be a fulfilling act of creative personal expression and a way to clarify your own understanding of a concept. Writing is an important part of this course because it is an important skill for your future careers/next steps in education. Lots of support and information here: &lt;https://writing.utoronto.ca/&gt;. 2.20.3 Course content is Accessible My intention is to make this course accessible as possible with captions for all video and audio and Quercus/course guide design that is easy for folks using screen readers to navigate. If there is something I could do differently in this area that would make your life easier and you‚Äôre comfortable to tell me, please do! One thing I know isn‚Äôt great but, regretfully, don‚Äôt have the resources to change, is the ‚Äòquality assurance‚Äô of the autogenerated captions for videos. Please reach out on Piazza if you‚Äôre ever unsure about something they say. The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost.

We‚Äôre excited you‚Äôre joining us on this statistical voyage. I look forward to introducing myself to you in our first class on Wednesday, but for now, there is are basic introductions below for me and our Head TA Amin. Feel free to skip to How this course works, I know there is a lot to read in the module! Looking forward to a great semester! See you in class on Wednesday. 3.1.1 Professor Liza Bolton, Instructor Email: sta303@utoronto.ca (Put ‚Äú[Prof. Bolton]‚Äù in the subject line to the email me directly) Pronouns: she/her Before moving (back) to Canada in 2019, I had lived more than half my life in New Zealand. (I still mention New Zealand a lot in class‚Ä¶) My current research areas are in statistics education and online learning, as well as health disparities across ethnic groups. I used to run a small consulting company and called myself a Data Ambassador. Why? Well, lots of people are consultants. I even did an internship in management consulting once upon a time. But it wasn‚Äôt a satisfying title for what I wanted my work with people to look like. I wanted something that focused on the communication and interpersonal side, not just high quality and appropriate analysis. People who aren‚Äôt confident in their ability to analyse their own data need a go-between, someone who can be an ambassador for their data! While I don‚Äôt do consulting any more, I love helping students build their technical and professional skills so they can go out into the world and be excellent ambassadors for data themselves. Last movie I cried in: Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service Favourite food: Corn. Popped, on the cob, in a chip, Mmmmm. Book most often given as a gift: A Matter of Fact: Talking Truth in a Post-Truth World by Jess Berentson-Shaw 3.1.2 Amin Banihashemi, Head TA Email: sta303@utoronto.ca (Amin will often be the one responding to your emails) Pronouns: he/him I‚Äôm a fourth-year PhD student at the Institute of Medical Science. I have been a TA for STA130 in DoSS for the past 3 years and this is my second semester as Head TA of STA303. My area of research is clinical Neuroscience, something I am passionate about. I analyze images of brain and eye structures in neurodegenerative diseases. I investigate possible associations of these structures with each other and with the ability to remember well and carry out goal-oriented tasks successfully. I love creating reproducible statistical analysis workflows in R. I also like audiobooks, candlelight, and apple pie (which I make myself!) 3.2 A few things to know upfront R is the programming language used in this course. I use and teach a lot of tidyverse, especially dplyr for data wrangling and ggplot for visualization. If you‚Äôre not familiar with these, consider getting ahead by checking out: chapters 3 and 5 of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham &amp; Garret Grolemund, and the DoSS Toolkit, especially the modules ‚ÄòHand me my plyrs‚Äô and To ggplot or not to ggplot. The entire course is online until Jan 31. While some elements of the delivery of STA303 may be in person after that, the course will have a large online component regardless and all assessments will be able to be completed and submitted online. If you are enrolled in an in-person tutorial, you will have an option to attend online instead. Synchronous attendance is NOT required to pass this course, but being able to attend (online) synchronously at the times in the timetable may make things easier for you. I cannot add students to a course, waive prerequisites or move them off a waitlist. If you or a friend have any questions of this nature, please reach out to the UG stats team (ug.statistics@utoronto.ca). Waitlisted STA303 students may access course materials by filling out this form, but they will not be able to complete assessments during this time. The course is designed to accommodate this. Check out my autoresponder message post for FAQs and other useful information. 3.2.1 Students joining off the waitlist You do not have to submit any assessments you missed while on the waitlist. They are all knowledge basket assessments and you will have multiple future opportunities to make up those grades. See the Syllabus for more information. If you have a friend on the waitlist, they can sign up to receive materials here. 3.3 How this course works This course is organized into five two-week modules of learning + two one-week assessment-focus weeks. All course material will be made available through this course guide and/or in Quercus. All times listed are ‚ÄòToronto time,‚Äô i.e. Eastern Time. Note that Daylight Savings Time begins Sunday, March 13, 2022.

Plan to be doing 6‚Äì8 hours of work on STA303 each week. In a two-week module, this may be comprised of: 2‚Äì4 hours on videos and readings 1‚Äì3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities 1‚Äì2 hours on knowledge basket assessments 2‚Äì6 hours on other assessments Remaining time attending reading announcements, office hours, checking Piazza, revision, etc. 3.4.1 Communication Our course discussion board on Piazza is to be used for all content and administration questions. Only sensitive or personal issues/questions should be sent to sta303@utoronto.ca. We reserve the right not to respond to emails that should be Piazza posts. Please ensure all course-related emails include your UTORID. There are several important forms that you may need if you miss an assessment due to illness or emergency or wish to request a regrade of an assessment. I will use Quercus announcements to share course information and updates. Please make sure you read these. I may also occasionally email or Quercus message you about things that relate specifically to you. 3.5 To do now Read the Syllabus (pdf version here) Join the Piazza discussion board.

Or, more relevant to this course, if you do a data analysis and can‚Äôt share it with anyone in helpful ways, did youreally do anything? With this in mind, you will have the opportunity to choose an area of relevant professional development to pursue over the course of the semester. This could include technical skills that make you better at collaborating with others (version control, Git, GitHub), creating things others will find useful (an R package) or practising communication (oral or written). There is a 1% proposal due fairly early in the semester, and then the final submission of evidence of, and reflection on, your activity is worth 3% and due toward the end of the semster. Example professional development tasks include: Learning how to set up and use Git and GitHub (this might come in handy if collaborating on the final project with a group) Setting up a personal profile website (a bit like a digital CV, GitHub provides free hosting for simple sites) Participating in weekly TidyTuesday activities Writing a stats blog Developing an R package and sharing it on GitHub A public speaking based activity like a debating society or Toastmasters Conducting a series of interviews with industry professional or academics and publishing videos/write-ups Create a wildly successful stats memes TikTok √† la Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti (okay, maybe not this one‚Ä¶but she‚Äôs well worth checking out) Note: the task must be related to communication or collaboration in some way. For example, ‚Äòlearning SQL‚Äô would not be sufficiently directly related to communication or collaboration, but developing an R package and sharing it with others requires communication (writing the documentation) and is a great way to contribute to the collaborative and supportive R community. If you are not sure, please ask! You will use the SMART goals framework (see image below) when setting out your proposal.

Your final version is saved as a PDF. 12.1.5 Things to keep in minds as you start working towards your professional development goal Track your time A time sheet should be part of your evidence submission Create a work log document or file to store screenshots in, make notes of tasks you‚Äôve completed This will make writing your reflection much easier 12.1.6 Example smart goal Note: This is not a collaboration/communication goal, but provides some examples of how to approach a SMART goal. Where there are ellipses (‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù) we are suggesting there would be more of the same, but this example should be enough to give you the idea. You should not use ellipses in this way in your own proposal. 12.1.6.1 Specific Goal: ‚ÄúClimb to the peak of Mount Robson over 2 weeks in January and write one blog post for my website about the journey.‚Äù Bad example: ‚ÄúClimb a mountain and write about it.‚Äù Which mountain?

Create a reproducible example (reprex) for use in explaining an error being produced by your code. 14.2 Instructor information Prof. Liza Bolton Course email: sta303@utoronto.ca Office hours: During the second half of Wednesday classes: 11:10‚Äî12:00 p.m. ET and 4:10‚Äî5:00 p.m. ET Please do not email my individual email with STA303 questions or use Quercus mail. It makes it harder to keep track of and address your questions. Sending me messages on three different platforms will NOT speed up my response. I will not respond messages that don‚Äôt follow the course communication policy. You can see the latest version of my email autoresponder here. 14.3 Upward management tips ‚ÄòUpward management‚Äô is basically managing your manager.9 If you make their life easier and help them be more effective, this should also make your life easier and is a good investment in your own career and skills building. While our course isn‚Äôt a business, some of the basic parts of this concept apply well to your time at university AND can set you up for success in graduate studies and your future career. But why should you put effort into upward managing me? Well, while I will always seek to treat all students fairly and to listen to your feedback, YOU can make this easier or harder for me, and thus make this course better or worse for yourselves. For example, if I have to use all my time and energy following up on unclear emails for more information and dealing with students who haven‚Äôt followed instructions etc. etc‚Ä¶.I won‚Äôt have that energy to put into writing TeamUp! activities to give you extra practice and opportunities to earn bonus points. 14.3.1 Communicate using the tools your manager prefers In business, this means knowing who likes face-to-face vs email, or whether your manager would rather receive an instant message than an email for a quick question. In STA303, this means: Using Piazza for all course admin and content questions. Using the appropriate forms for accommodations and regrade requests. Emailing sta303@utoronto.ca for private issues not otherwise covered by the other tools, e.g. emailing me your Accommodation Services letter, requesting an extension to an assessment that conflicts with essential travel. Asking questions in office hours. 14.3.2 Write good emails (when emails are appropriate) In business, this might mean: Choosing who should be the main recipients vs CCed/BCCed. Ensuring your contact details are clear in your signature. Make sure the subject line is informative and short Making the text of the email as clear and concise as possible. Use proper grammar and punctuation. Don‚Äôt use emoji in formal emails. If in doubt, leave ‚Äôem out. In STA303, this looks like: Everything in the right-hand column, plus the following. Starting an email with ‚ÄúHi Prof. Bolton,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHi Liza,‚Äù10 Sign off the email with your preferred name (i.e. what should I call you when I reply) and if your have different official name, include that and your UTORid below your name. Subject line including [Prof. Bolton] or [TA name] if your email is for a specific person. 14.3.3 Understand your manager‚Äôs goals In business, this might look like understanding their KPIs and how you can help make sure these are met. In STA303, most of my goals are for you, like that you learn useful statistical skills, improve your writing skills etc. I also personally want to improve as an instructor and have fun talking about something I love. You can help me with these goals by working on this course every week, trying your best, asking for help early and often, engaging with feedback gathering mechanisms and providing constructive feedback if something is not working. 14.3.4 Demonstrate self-management and resilience while also asking for help and flagging problems early. In business, this might look like: Being proactive about addressing possible problems before they occur. Managers like a ‚Äòno surprises‚Äô policy. Preparing a list of questions to cover in a meeting or to compile in an organized fashion into one email (instead of ten). Searching for answers yourself before asking your manager and improving your strategies for finding available information. In STA303, this looks like: Putting in a little effort into find answers before posting on Piazza/asking in class. (Have you searched Piazza? have you re-read/watched the assigned materials? have your checked the syllabus and recent announcements?) Come to office hours often, lists of questions very welcome! Getting in touch (or asking your registrar to) early if you might hate to miss a lot of class. It is usually easier to find a solution if I know things ahead of time, or as soon as possible after. 14.4 Recap of linear models 14.4.1 Why model? The goal of a model is to provide a (relatively) simple summary of a dataset. We can describe data AND make predictions. 14.4.2 Linear models In a linear model, \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + ... + \\beta_px_{pi} + \\epsilon_i\\) The response is predicted by a linear function of explanatory (or predictor) variables plus an error term. a.k.a. DATA = MODEL + ERROR 14.4.3 Linear regression assumptions L: your model is Linear. I: Errors are Independent (usually satisfied if observations are independent). N: Errors are Normally distributed with expected value zero, \\(E[\\epsilon_i]=0\\) E: Equal/constant variance (homoscedasticity), \\(\\text{var}[\\epsilon_i] = \\sigma^2\\). We can express ‚ÄúI N E‚Äù above as assuming the errors are i.i.d Normal with mean of zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), \\[\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\] 14.4.4 What makes it a linear model? A model is linear if it is linear in the parameters. That is, all the \\(\\beta\\) enter the model in a linear way. It is totally fine if the predictor variables enter the model in a non-linear way. 14.4.4.1 Linear \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\beta_2x_i^2 + \\epsilon_i\\) \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + Œ≥_1Œ¥_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2\\exp(x_{2i}) + \\epsilon_i\\) 14.4.4.2 NOT linear \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i^{\\beta_2} + \\epsilon_i\\) \\(y_i = \\beta_0 exp(\\beta_1x_{1i}) + \\epsilon_i\\) Internally screaming ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT LET THE BETAS TOUCH‚Äù often helps me remember what is not linear. Additionally, don‚Äôt let them do anything weird, like get exponentiated. 14.4.5 Optional refresher reading 14.4.5.1 Brief discussion of assumptions with examples Section 1.3 of Broaden your Statistical Horizons on the assumptions of OLS https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-bysh/ch-MLRreview.html#ordinary-least-squares-ols-assumptions [freely accessible] 14.4.5.2 Fitting linear models in R Section 1.6 of Broaden your Statistical Horizons on Multiple linear regression (bootstrapping not assessed) https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-bysh/ch-MLRreview.html#multreg [freely accessible] 14.4.5.3 Delicious mathematics Chapter 1 of Wood, S.

One of the most common issues students encounter when learning R is that they are trying to use functions that they haven‚Äôt installed or loaded the package for. Make sure you‚Äôve read the slides about RStudio on the JupyerHub because packages you install there will need to be reinstalled each session if they are not the list of automatically available ones. tidyverse is automatically available so you only need to run library(tidyverse) or use the namespace for the function tibble::glimpse(). 14.5.2 The variables I hope most of the variables here are clear from their names. In particular, we will be interested in species, which has three levels (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap), sex (male, female, NA), body_mass_g (body mass in grams) and flipper_length_mm (length of their flippers measure in mm). We‚Äôre not using the variables about the bills, but I thought this diagram was interesting anyway. Artwork by @allison_horst ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Here are all our variables of interest in one plot. Note: In this chart and in future analyses involving sex, penguins with an unknown sex have been removed. 14.6 Common statistical tests as linear regression There is an interactive version of the below notes at this link. 14.6.1 Introduction You have probably encountered several statistical tests in your studies so far. 14.6.1.1 Parametric E.g. one-sample t-tests, paired t-tests, two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA Parametric tests make assumptions about the distribution of the population from which our sample data have been drawn. 14.6.1.2 Non-parametric E.g. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallace Non-parametric tests do not assume that our outcome is Normally distributed. They are sometimes called ‚Äòdistribution-free,‚Äô but note that this is because they have fewer assumptions than parametric tests, not because they have no assumptions at all. 14.6.1.3 Aside: But why are there two types of tests? Parametric tests are more powerful, i.e., they have a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one there to find. So why would you ever use a less powerful test? Well, with great power comes great responsibility more assumptions that must be valid to proceed. Non-parametric tests are a great choice when your outcome is an ordinal variable, is ranks, or there are problematic outliers. For the purposes of this lesson, we‚Äôre going to focus more on parametric tests, but also take a look at the corresponding non-parametric tests with the slight white lie that they are just ranked versions of their parametric companions. This approach is pretty good as long as you have a reasonable sample size. Imagine this: You‚Äôre on a ship trying to spot land. Parametric tests are the crew member with the best eyesight, but they can be fussy and the conditions have to be right for them to work in or they will breakdown. Non-parametric tests are the crew member with not quite as good eyesight, but they‚Äôre more laid back about the conditions you make them work in. In the following sections we‚Äôll explore several of these tests. 14.6.2 One-sample t-test I am assuming you‚Äôve seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below. 14.6.2.1 Use case You want to know if it is believable that the population mean is a certain value (our ‚Äòhypothesized value‚Äô below). 14.6.2.2 Assumptions The data are continuous. The data are normally distributed. The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample (Do these sound familiar from linear regression?) 14.6.2.3 Hypotheses \\[H_0: \\mu = \\text{hypothesized val}\\] \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne \\text{hypothesized val}\\] What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population mean is some hypothesized value. The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows: \\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\text{hypothesized val}}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\] We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom df = n - 1 and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme. 14.6.2.4 Example Suppose existing research suggests that the average weight of penguins is 4000 grams. You want to see if this makes sense for your new penguins data. \\[H_0: \\mu = 4000\\] \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne 4000\\] The penguins dataset is already loaded, you you don‚Äôt have to run any libraries. Use the t.test() function run a one-sample t-test. t.test(penguins$body_mass_g, mu = 4000, var.equal = TRUE) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: penguins$body_mass_g ## t = 4.6525, df = 341, p-value = 4.7e-06 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 4000 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 4116.458 4287.050 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 4201.754 14.6.2.5 Now as a linear model First, consider the following, what would a linear regression with no predictor variables and just an intercept tell you? Create a linear regression model called mod1(replace the blank below) that is an ‚Äòintercept only model‚Äô with body_mass_g as the response. mod1 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ 1, data=penguins) summary(mod1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ 1, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1501.8 -651.8 -151.8 548.2 2098.2 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 4201.75 43.36 96.89 &lt;2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom ## (2 observations deleted due to missingness) It turns out the estimate from this linear regression is the same as the sample mean. mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE) #na.rm = TRUE removes missing values ## [1] 4201.754 Now, recall that with the t-test, we calculate our test statistic by subtracting the hypothesized value from the mean. Let‚Äôs run the linear model again, but on the left-hand side of the formula, subtract the hypothesized value. mod2 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g-4000 ~ 1, data=penguins) summary(mod2) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g - 4000 ~ 1, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1501.8 -651.8 -151.8 548.2 2098.2 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 201.75 43.36 4.652 4.7e-06 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom ## (2 observations deleted due to missingness) Compare the results of this summary(mod2) and your earlier t-test. You should see that the t value, degrees of freedom and p-value are the same for both analyses. Thus, our one sample t-test hypotheses, \\[H_0: \\mu = \\text{hypothesized val}\\] \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne \\text{hypothesized val}\\] are equivalent to our linear regression hypotheses about the intercept, \\[H_0: \\beta_0 = \\text{hypothesized val}\\] \\[H_1: \\beta_0 \\ne \\text{hypothesized val}.\\] 14.6.2.6 Wilcoxon signed-rank test While the linear regression approach to the one-sample t-test is exact, we can also approximate the Wilcoxon rank-sign test with linear regression. See below. Note: The above is just example from some toy data, but aims to illustrate how a t-test is treating the data and how the Wilcoxon test is treating the data. # Function to get signed rank of each observation signed_rank = function(x) sign(x) * rank(abs(x)) # The wilcoxon test function wilcox.test(penguins$body_mass_g, mu = 4000) ## ## Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction ## ## data: penguins$body_mass_g ## V = 34723, p-value = 0.0004829 ## alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 4000 # Equivalent linear model mod3 &lt;- lm(signed_rank(penguins$body_mass_g-4000) ~ 1) summary(mod3) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = signed_rank(penguins$body_mass_g - 4000) ~ 1) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -334.63 -173.13 -22.13 187.87 305.37 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Likewise for the Wilcoxon. The R code (not evaluated here) would be as follows: # Built-in Wilcoxon matched pairs wilcox.test(x1, x2, paired = TRUE) # Equivalent linear model: summary(lm(signed_rank(x1 - x2) ~ 1)) 14.6.3 Dummy variables Let‚Äôs take a quick detour before we explore the next tests. We‚Äôll need to understand the concept of dummy variables and contrasts first. 14.6.3.1 The matrices we use for linear regression Recall that we can express our linear regression in matrix form: \\[\\mathbf{y} = X\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon\\] where \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\\\ y_2 \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ y_n \\end{pmatrix} , \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol\\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\\\ \\beta_2 \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ \\beta_p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\\\ \\varepsilon_2 \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ \\varepsilon_n \\end{pmatrix} \\] and \\[X = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; x_{11} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1p} \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{21} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{n1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{np} \\end{pmatrix}\\] We often talk about X as the model matrix (or design or regressor matrix) and it will be the focus of this section. 14.6.3.2 Getting our model matrix in R Let‚Äôs start by fitting a model with body_mass_g as the response and flipper_length_mm and species as the predictor variables. (Note: Users of statistics use a lot of different words to refer to the same thing. Can you think of other terms people might use instead of response and predictor?) mod4 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species, data=penguins) summary(mod4) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -927.70 -254.82 -23.92 241.16 1191.68 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

I‚Äôve applied head() to stop the entire thing being printed. head(model.matrix(mod4), n = 20) ## (Intercept) flipper_length_mm speciesChinstrap speciesGentoo ## 1 1 181 0 0 ## 2 1 186 0 0 ## 3 1 195 0 0 ## 5 1 193 0 0 ## 6 1 190 0 0 ## 7 1 181 0 0 ## 8 1 195 0 0 ## 9 1 193 0 0 ## 10 1 190 0 0 ## 11 1 186 0 0 ## 12 1 180 0 0 ## 13 1 182 0 0 ## 14 1 191 0 0 ## 15 1 198 0 0 ## 16 1 185 0 0 ## 17 1 195 0 0 ## 18 1 197 0 0 ## 19 1 184 0 0 ## 20 1 194 0 0 ## 21 1 174 0 0 You‚Äôll notice that even though we only had an intercept and two variables, we have four columns in our model matrix. You should also notice that R has given the columns helpful names, and that we have a column for the Chinstrap species and the Gentoo species, but not the Adelie species. Further, recall that when we are working with a categorical variables we call the different values the the variables can take ‚Äúlevels‚Äù. I may also refer to these as factor variables, and talk about the ‚Äúlevels of the factor.‚Äù What R is doing is dropping the first level (alphabetically) of the categorical variable and then creating dummy variables for each of the other levels. The dropped level becomes our reference level and this should be familiar from interpreting summary output in previous courses where you have conducted multiple linear regressions with categorical variables. A dummy variable is also called an indicator variable, and it indicates whether or not the given observation takes that level or not. I.e., if the 40th penguin in this dataset had a 1 in the speciesGentoo column, then I know it is a Gentoo penguin, and that it won‚Äôt have a 1 in the speciesChinstrap column because each penguin can only have one species. More generally, the sum across the row of the dummy variables for one categorical variable will either be 0 (if that observation has the reference level) or 1 (not the reference level) but you will never have more than one ‚Äòone‚Äô amongst the dummies for a given categorical variable. 14.6.3.2.0.1 [Unassessed aside] Why do we have to drop one of the levels? You may recall that for the matrix calculations required to get our vector of \\(\\beta\\)s, we need to be able to invert X our matrix. We can only invert matrices for which all the columns are linearly independent and if we have the intercept AND dummies for all the levels of the categorical variable, our matrix will be linearly dependent. Additional optional discussion here. 14.6.4 Two means Back to tests! Independent t-tests let you compare two means. I am assuming you‚Äôve seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below. 14.6.4.1 Use case You want to know if it is believable that two independent groups have the same population mean. 14.6.4.2 Assumptions The data are continuous. The data are normally distributed (in each group). Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample The variances for the groups are equal. Notice that these are the same assumptions as the one-sample t-test, but with the equality of variances assumption added. 14.6.4.3 Hypotheses \\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\] \\[H_1: \\mu_1 \\ne \\mu_2\\] What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population means for both groups are the same. This differs from the one sample test because we have uncertainty about BOTH values here. Both are population parameters that we don‚Äôt know. The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows: \\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x_1} - \\bar{x_2}}{\\sqrt{s^2(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}} \\] We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom \\(df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\\) and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme. 14.6.4.4 Example Conduct an independent t-test to test if the mean of body_mass_g is the same for male and female penguins (sex). Add your code below. Note: you must set , var.equal = TRUE as one of the arguments for it two be the independent t-test. If you don‚Äôt set this we are conducting a Welch‚Äôs t-test. I won‚Äôt be covering this, but it is covered in the source credited at the end of this activity. t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins, var.equal = TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: body_mass_g by sex ## t = -8.5417, df = 331, p-value = 4.897e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -840.8014 -526.0222 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group female mean in group male ## 3862.273 4545.685 Now, based on what we‚Äôve learned, write a linear model using the lm() function to do the same this as our independent t-test. Save the model as mod5. mod5 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins) summary(mod5) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1295.7 -595.7 -237.3 737.7 1754.3 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

There is a difference here in that the sign of the test statistics differs. That does not matter as out t-distribution is symmetrical and we‚Äôre doing a two-tailed test. 14.6.4.5 Mann-Whitney U Similar idea to before, except for this test it is just rank not signed rank. # Wilcoxon / Mann-Whitney U (multiple names) wilcox.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins) ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction ## ## data: body_mass_g by sex ## W = 6874.5, p-value = 1.813e-15 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 # As linear model with our dummy-coded group_y2: summary(lm(rank(body_mass_g) ~ sex, data = penguins)) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = rank(body_mass_g) ~ sex, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -183.68 -74.13 -16.63 91.32 162.87 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Let‚Äôs look specifically at one-way ANOVA (or the F-test). It tests if all the means for several groups (more than 2) are the same or if at least one is different. I hope this sounds a bit like the next evolution from the independent t-test‚Ä¶ (+ 1000 stats respect points to anyone who draws Pokemon-esque evolutions of these three tests‚Ä¶with regression as the mega-evolution‚Ä¶) 14.6.5.2 Assumptions And it just so happens that the assumptions for the one-way ANOVA (also called the F-test) are EXACTLY the same as for the independent t-test. The data are continuous. The data are normally distributed (in each group). Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample The variances for the groups are equal. 14.6.5.3 Hypotheses \\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = ... = \\mu_k \\] \\[H_1: \\text{at least one }\\mu \\text{ differs from the others} \\] 14.6.5.4 Example Let‚Äôs now look at body mass across species. Suppose we wanted to know if was believable that the the means body mass in grams was the same across all three species. This is when we could fit a quick ANOVA to test this. The aov() allows us to do this. summary(aov(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins)) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## species 2 146864214 73432107 343.6 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Residuals 339 72443483 213698 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## 2 observations deleted due to missingness That looks a lot like the output from calling summary on lm()‚Ä¶in fact, aov is just a wrapper for lm! Which means it has been linear regression the whole time. 14.6.6 Credits Credit to Jonas Kristoffer Lindel√∏v for the excellent resource this resource is based on. There are more examples there than we will cover in this course. 14.7 Reproducible examples (reprex) 14.7.1 What is a reproducible example? Well, it is an example that someone else can reproduce‚Ä¶ Specifically, it is a minimal example needed for someone helping you to reproduce an error or other behaviour you would like to show them with. This is especially helpful while we are all working online! I can‚Äôt look over your shoulder in a lab to see what‚Äôs wrong. 14.7.2 Why should you care about creating reproducible examples? Useful professional skill for those working with R and other programming languages in graduate school/future employment (concepts transferable to programming in any language). The best way to help me (and the TAs and your classmates) help YOU on Piazza. The process of preparing a reprex to ask for help forces you to think about your code in a specific way that can help you spot the problem without actually having to ask anyone else (this literally happened to me about 2 hours before writing this slide!) 14.7.2.1 Other things to know Please try to use use reprexes when asking for help on Piazza! The outputs from the reprex package work beautifully on Piazza, too. No more upside down photos of computer screens taken from phones, please! reprex is installed in the JupyterHub and will be loaded whenever we run library(tidyverse) You won‚Äôt have to worry about the data side of reprexes as much for this course, as in almost all cases we will all be working with the same data. But! It is a key skill if you will be working with data and programming languages in the future. 14.7.3 Watch the creator of the reprex package explain it Jenny Bryan is a hero of mine, and this was even BEFORE I knew she was the creator of the reprex package. I think the whole video is excellent, and you‚Äôre very welcome to watch all of it, but at minimum, please watch the following time intervals: 0:00 - 7:20 (background and initial demo) 14:08 - 29:48 (philosophy and examples) The video and slides are on this page: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/learn-reprex.html 14.7.4 Using reprexes on Piazza Watch this 4 minute video. Web version embedding for MyMedia is not great, I would recommending opening the link and/or going full screen. 14.8 Reading strategy: previewing and skimming In graduate school and/or in future employment, it is likely that you will need gather and synthesize information from a range of written sources. To decide if a source is useful to you, and to be as efficient and effective as possible, it is important to have strategies for approaching reading. In the next module, for the knowledge basket writing task, you will be guided through reading an article called Science isn‚Äôt broken and asked to respond to it. You can also keep this in mind as a stategry for ‚Äòfirst reads‚Äô of course notes, or when re-reading to find some. Previewing a written text helps you think about the origins and purpose of the text, how it is organised, and where you expect to find information. Skimming is done after previewing, and is a strategy of reading key paragraphs, like the first and last which usually introduce and conclude the piece, as well as reading the opening sentences of in-between paragraphs and paying attention to figures, captions and any other emphasized text. 14.9 Getting ahead on Module 2 Students who are unfamiliar with the tidyverse, especially dplyr and ggplot2, may find Module 2 to be quite full on. You may wish to start the readings for the next module early in this case. Wickham &amp; Grolemund.

Your U of T login should work with all of them. The below PDF file provides an overview of how you‚Äôll be interacting with each one. At the bottom of the page is an embedded slideshow introducing you to the JupyterHub. You can always access Piazza from the Navigation Menu on the left. Instructions for setting up your U of T Zoom are on the Zoom page and links are in the Navigation menu and on the home page. 19.1.1 Admin Logo Description Quercus will be used for timed assessments, some submissions and announcements. Synchronous classes and office hours will be hosted via Zoom. You MUST join using your U of T Zoom account to be admitted. Get your account: utoronto.zoom.us Microsoft Forms will be used for several important administrative forms. You will need to be signed in to your U of T account in the same browser to access these. Markus will be used for the submission of code and analysis documentation for several assessments. peerScholar will be used for the Create, Asses and Reflect phases of the module writing and peer review tasks. You can access the peerScholar links through the associated Quercus assessments. 19.2 Using RStudio with the JupyterHub We will be using R through RStudio to conduct analyses in this course. If you have a local installation of R you are welcome to continue using that, but, for this course, you do not need to have R and RStudio installed. Instead, assessments and activities will be shared through the U of T JupyterHub. This gives you access to RStudio in your browser through your U of T login on any internet-connected device. It means you don‚Äôt have to fight package installations and we can instead focus on the good stuff. Please read through the following slides, experiment with the example sharing link, make sure you know how to knit an Rmd to pdf + export the pdf, and practice navigating and moving files. Link: https://rstudio-with-jupyerhub-uoft.netlify.app. 19.3 Team Up! Link to student-facing Quercus Support resources. Please only attend one of these sessions if you are prepared to‚Ä¶ Image description: Captain Picard (of the Starship Enterprise) in uniform, pointing forwards. Text reads: ENGAGE 19.3.1 To participate in these activities, you need: A U of T LICENSED Zoom account to access the call. Some troubleshooting tips in this announcement: Make sure your Zoom is licensed!. A reasonable internet connection. A working microphone. To be WILLING TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE. Please don‚Äôt ruin this for others who are interested in engaging in meaningful group problem-solving. There is no reason to come and lurk. These sessions are the activity and nothing else. You can easily get marks for your knowledge basket in SOOO many other ways AND I will make an asynchronous practice version available so you don‚Äôt miss out on practice. 19.3.2 Before the activity you should: Remember that you don‚Äôt have to participate in Team Up! activities, there are plenty of other ways to earn your knowledge basket marks. Only participate if you really are going to participate (see above). Check you can access Shiny interactives on the JupyterHub: Module 1 interactive. If you get a ‚ÄòNot Found‚Äô error this is most likely due to one of two issues: Solution 1: Ensure you don‚Äôt have any other interactives open. (Close any tabs with the orange-arcs JupyterHub logo). Solution 2: Go to https://jupyter.utoronto.ca, open a new RStudio session by going New -&gt; RStudio (see slide 3 of these instructions) and move any .Rmd files in your üè†Home directory (see slide 10 of these instructions) to a new folder (or delete them if you don‚Äôt need them). Remember: No naked Rmds in YOUR home! Decide if you want to be randomized into a group or work with a group of people you already know in the course (section/tut enrolment doesn‚Äôt matter). If randomizing, join the Zoom link for the tutorial time you are attending. ‚ÄòArrive‚Äô on time as latecomers may not be placed in a group. If working with your own group, you don‚Äôt need to join the call (but can if you get stuck with the tech!). Decide at which time you want to do the activity and set up a personal Zoom/Teams/WeChat/Instagram/carrier pigeon/semaphore chat. Zoom has nothing to do with Team Up!. Read over the Team Up! instructions below. 19.3.3 Some rules/logistics Speak up! Practice talking about statistics. For these activities, I‚Äôd honestly rather you be wrong out loud than right in silence. Be kind and constructive. You are in a team, practice being a good team member. Team Up! does not have a great back end. If you don‚Äôt submit correctly or don‚Äôt join a group correctly, I CANNOT go in and check or move you around. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. No accommodations will be made for Team Up! issues. Team Up! marks will not be updated by hand (e.g., if you end up in a solo group/tech issues, etc.). You must do this as a group activity, during a tutorial time, if you wish to receive a knowledge basket grade. A ‚Äògroup‚Äô is 2‚Äì4 people. All members of groups of 1 (solos) and 5+ will receive a zero. Group size is based on what is recorded by Team Up! through your registration with your group codes. You cannot do a Team Up! more than once. You cannot attend both sessions. If you have a ghost üëªin your room (randomized in the class organized Zoom call), please ‚ÄòAsk for help‚Äô (there is a button). ‚ÄòRaise hand‚Äô doesn‚Äôt alert me if you‚Äôre in a breakout room. Timing note: Assessment pages will become available at 15 minutes past the hour and remain available for 45 minutes. Ensure sure your team submits by the end of the session. 19.3.4 Team Up! Instructions Participating in Team Up! activities can earn you knowledge basket points. They will be based on how well your team does, so work together and give it a good effort. You will complete the following 5 steps: .midi[ 1. Introductions (first/personal name + a one-word description of how your week is going so far). Use this time to confirm everyone understands the instructions. 2. Driver sets up Team Up! group 3. Members join Team Up! group 4. Complete the activity 5. Submit the activity 19.3.4.1 Step 1: Decide on roles You will need: An Instructions Master who is responsible for helping the team follow these instructions carefully. A Screensharer who is responsible for sharing the activity on their screen. A Driver for the Team Up! side of the activity. The Driver acts as team leader, responsible for navigating the quiz, confirming the team‚Äôs final agreed upon answer to a question, and submitting the completed quiz score to Quercus.The Driver has a steering wheel next to their ID and is differently coloured than other Team Members. Team Members (other than the Driver) participate and choose vote on answers, so all team mates can see what they have chosen, but they cannot submit their choices to Team Up!. DECIDE THIS BEFORE CLICKING ANYTHING TO DO WITH TEAM UP! 19.3.4.2 Step 2: Driver sets up group The person in your group whose first/personal name comes last alphabetically will be the Leader (Driver) for the session. The Driver must do the below steps FIRST to get the group code. Then they will share the group code with all the members of the group so they can also join. 1 Log-in to Quercus from your device (phone, tablet, computer). 1 Click on the Team Up! assignment from the Course Overview page. 2 Click ‚ÄòGo to Tool.‚Äô If it is not appearing, refresh your page or try a different browser. NON-DRIVERS! DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING! 3 Choose ‚ÄúCreate New Group‚Äù 4 Share group ID in Zoom 19.3.4.3 Step 3: Members join Once the Driver has shared the group ID, AND ONLY THEN do the following: 1 Click on the Team Up! assignment from the Course Overview page. 2 Click ‚ÄòGo to Tool.‚Äô If it is not appearing, refresh your page or try a different browser. 3 Input the code your driver provided and click ‚ÄòJoin Group.‚Äô 19.3.4.4 Step 4: Complete the activity You will need to have the interactive activity (question document) associated with this task open on to see the answer options and update any code. Be prepared to switch between Team Up! and the JupyterHub tab. The Driver chooses a question, and the team can participate by choosing their own answers and discussing their choices with each other. Once the team decides on a final answer, the driver chooses it and clicks the Check Answer button. Note: The Driver can check an answer despite what the team members choose, so be careful that you have consensus before clicking the Check Answer button. You cannot undo. If the answer is correct, you will be awarded the full score or ‚Äúdiamonds‚Äù for that question. You will be able to proceed onward by clicking the Next button that will appear under the Check Answer button or by clicking on a question in the menu on the left. If your team‚Äôs answer is not correct, discuss the question and choose again. Repeat until you get the correct answer. All teammates can see whether responses are correct/incorrect as well as their team‚Äôs overall score as they progress through the Team Up! session. 19.3.4.5 Step 5: The Driver MUST click Submit to Quercus for your answers to be processed. If this is not done, no one on the team will get a grade!!!! 19.4 Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom‚Ä¶ Access to STA303 synchronous meetings and office hours is restricted to our students. Set up your U of T Zoom account 19.4.1 Make sure your Zoom is up to date To participate fully, you will need Desktop client or mobile app: version 5.3.0 or higher. You can check your desktop client or mobile app version by following these instructions. 19.4.2 Customize! Once you have logged in, please customize your profile: Update your name to your preferred name (what you would like us to call you in class) Note: this may not be allowed with your U of T settings, so don‚Äôt worry if this doesn‚Äôt work. Add a profile picture (please make it a photo of YOU or an avatar that looks like you‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt want Snoopy or Joe Biden11 in class) 19.4.3 VPN There is a University of Toronto VPN (UTORvpn) that you have access to as a student. It may help with video quality and access to U of T resources. If you are based in mainland China, the Alibaba Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN)Links to an external site. service should help with your Quercus access. 19.4.4 Notes: Please always use your real name and face for this course, and be cautious about changing them and your virtual background for other meetings. A joke background for a call with family or friends may not be appropriate for class. For class meetings, the settings will always be that your camera and microphone are off to begin with so you have the control to check these things first. We do ask that, when possible, you use your microphone in office hours, breakout groups and any other small group meetings and strongly prefer that you use your camera AND microphone. We trust you to make the best choice for your environment, comfort and learning. You may get a ‚ÄúThis meeting is for authorized participants only message.‚Äù Choose the ‚ÄúSign in with SSO‚Äù option to sign in. 19.4.5 Changing your profile picture on Zoom and Quercus Follow these instructions to add a profile picture (or bitmoji style avatar if you‚Äôd prefer) to Quercus and Zoom. I want this experience to be more social and less faceless. Please don‚Äôt use photos of cartoon characters, etc. A good photo will be a close-up of your face so we can see who you are even when the photo is small. 19.4.6 What to do if you experience technical difficulties during class? First, (if possible) send me a chat note that you‚Äôre having technical difficulties and are working to resolve them. Second, leave the meeting and re-enter. This often resets things and resolves the problem. Before entering the meeting, make sure all of your devices are properly plugged in and Bluetooth devices are connected. If that doesn‚Äôt fix things, exit the meeting again and update your Zoom Client. This is the Zoom software that should be on your computer. Here‚Äôs a short video tutorial explaining how to update the software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7zERcVLUBM. After updating, enter the meeting again to see if this resolved your problems. Our synchronous classes are recorded, so if your technology is just going catastrophically wrong, go get a cup of tea/coffee/water and relax, you can catch up with the recording when it is posted on Quercus. 19.4.7 What to do if your instructor or TA is experiencing technical difficulties on Zoom First, check the chat to see if the instructor or the project mentor have said what is going on and what they are doing to fix things and follow any instructions they give. Second, if they have disappeared completely, wait 10 minutes (or until the end of the meeting time, whichever comes first) before closing the call. (You can do other things in the meantime, but be ready to jump back in). Third, expect to see an announcement on Quercus afterwards telling you what to do (e.g. it might be to watch a video I‚Äôll record later, to review some slides or perhaps there is nothing to do and i‚Äôll see you next time). 19.5 Student support services and resources 19.5.1 Mental health support You may find yourself feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or anxious. Lots of people feel the same way. There is help available from mental health professionals 24 hours a day via online and phone-based services. Here are some that are available to U of T students: MySSP - My Student Support Program 1-844-451-9700, or outside of Canada call 001-416-380-6578 Good2Talk Student Helpline 1-866-925-5454, or text GOOD2TALK to 686868 Distress Centres of Greater Toronto 416-408-4357, or text 45645 There is also the new Navi tool for U of T students, it is a chatbot and your questions are totally anonymous. http://uoft.me/navi The student union are also curating a list here: https://www.utsu.ca/mental-health/ 19.5.2 General University resources The following are some important links to help you with academic and/or technical service and support: Health &amp; Wellness can help with appointments with a range of clinicians, nutrition, immunizations, sexual and reproductive health and much more.

On this page you will find information for: Messages from Dean Woodin can be found on the A&amp;S latest updates page. Yes, these are real images students have used.‚Ü©Ô∏é "],["faqs-and-errata.html", "20 FAQs and Errata 20.1 Frequently asked questions 20.2 Other 20.3 Errata", " 20 FAQs and Errata 20.1 Frequently asked questions While Piazza is our main class question and answer board, this page will have some static Questions and Answers for frequently asked questions. Use Cmd + F (Mac) or Ctrl + F (PC) to search for keywords on this page. Additionally, make sure you‚Äôre familiar with the Syllabus. I‚Äôve tried to explain as much as I could there. 20.1.1 Course admin 20.1.1.1 STA303 pre-requisites 20.1.1.1.1 I didn‚Äôt take STA302 or an equivalent course, can I still take STA303? No, sorry. We enforce pre-reqs strictly. This isn‚Äôt up to me. You will be removed from the course. Please reach out to the UG stats team (ug.statistics@utoronto.ca) about questions of this nature. Book an appointment during their office hours. For grad courses, please email grad.statistics@utoronto.ca. 20.1.1.2 Lecture and tutorial times 20.1.1.2.1 How exactly do the tutorials and lectures work? Wednesdays: 1st part is (recorded) content/demo and the second is office hour (unrecorded). Aiming for half-half, but will vary. Thursdays: The 1st Thursday of a module will have a Team Up! or other practice activity. This will also be made available asynchronously, but the knowledge basket points for a Team Up! can only be earned by synchronous, group participation. The 2nd Thursday will be drop-in TA office hours to get help on content and assessments. Thursday sessions are not recorded, but the Team Up! or other activities content will be made available to everyone. There are several other ways to earn your knowledge basket points if this doesn‚Äôt suit your tech setup (e.g. no mic) or time zone. 20.1.1.3 Recorded lectures 20.1.1.3.1 ‚ÄúWhere can I find recorded lectures and how soon can I expect them to be available?‚Äù Recorded lectures will be linked on the Course overview page. I aim to have the links up within 24 hours of class. They take some time to process. 20.1.1.4 Sections 20.1.1.4.1 ‚ÄúDo L0101 and L0201 cover the same materials?‚Äù Yes. The only difference is when your synchronous class is. See the below question in ‚ÄúAttending synchronous class.‚Äù 20.1.1.5 Attending synchronous class 20.1.1.5.1 ‚ÄúCan I attend the synchronous class for the other section?‚Äù Yes!* *If the number of attendees is getting too close to the call cap of 300 (this is a Zoom license thing), preference will be given to those enrolled in the session and others will be asked to leave. Any Team Up! activity bonuses will also be applied‚Äîsection/session does not matter. 20.1.1.5.2 ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I access the class/office hour Zoom meeting?‚Äù You must have and be signed in with your University of Toronto Zoom account. Use the ‚ÄòSSO‚Äô (single sign-on) option. More info and troubleshooting advice here. 20.1.1.5.3 ‚ÄúWill STA303/STA1002 be able to be completed online-only?‚Äù Yes. STA303 will be a flipped course, with content delivered online and opportunities for activities both in-person (subject to health advice) and online. All assessments will be completed and submitted online. If you are enrolled in an in-person tutorial, you will have an option to attend online instead. Synchronous attendance is NOT required to pass this course, but being able to attend (online) synchronously at the times in the timetable may make things easier for you. 20.1.1.5.4 ‚ÄúWhere is your office?‚Äù/‚ÄúCan I come see you in-person?‚Äù At this stage, I cannot offer in-person office hours nor student meetings in my office. Drop-ins are not currently allowed for any instructors or TAs in Statistical Sciences, unless they have told you they have organized another meeting space for this purpose. 20.1.2 Assessments FAQ 20.1.2.1 Knowledge basket FAQ 20.1.2.1.1 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really understand the knowledge basket, how will that work? Can we earn more than 5 marks?‚Äù The knowledge basket maxes out at 5%, otherwise I get in trouble for giving away too many ‚Äúfree‚Äù points. (I know, I wish.) 20.1.2.1.2 ‚ÄúCan we do as many knowledge basket activities as we want in order to gain the full 5%?‚Äù Yes! But do try to plan ahead, as I won‚Äôt be adding a bunch of make-up opportunities at the end‚Ä¶part of the goal is to incentivize personalized, regular participation in the course to create the best learning outcomes for you. 20.1.2.1.3 ‚ÄúHow fast will we receive grades back for the knowledge basket activities?‚Äù It will depend, but many should be fairly quick‚Äîa few days if autograded/based on completion. 1‚Äì2 weeks for professional development proposal and evidence &amp; reflection. 20.1.2.1.4 ‚ÄúI am not too sure what ‚Äòpre-knowledge quiz: 80% or workshop‚Äô is supposed to mean.‚Äù If you score 80% or more on the pre-knowledge check, you automatically get 0.5% for doing it + 0.5% for a high score. If you do the check but get less than 80% you get 0.5% for completion, and can still get that additional 0.5% if you come participate in the workshop. Workshop open to all. And you don‚Äôt have to go if you have other plan for filling your basket. It is meant to be helpful to you, though. And no, you can‚Äôt get the workshop AND 80%+ points. One or the other for a max of 1%. 20.1.2.1.5 ‚ÄúWhat will additional opportunities like speaker series reflections be like?‚Äù May vary depending on the speaker/workshop, but for next week (grad panel) it will likely be attendance + a short Quercus survey. Just confirming a few things still so, TBA. (Watch for more details in announcements.) 20.1.2.1.6 ‚ÄúAre the three phases of each writing assignment graded on completion?‚Äù Yes, but see caveats here in the general instructions for the writing tasks. 20.1.2.1.7 ‚ÄúNo questions, although seems to be a hectic course with a lot of minor deadlines.‚Äù If you don‚Äôt want lots of little deadlines, you don‚Äôt have to have lots of little deadlines! Do the professional development tasks + a few Team Ups! or the professional development task + punctuation art. Throw in the pre-knowledge check and you‚Äôre looking great! 20.1.2.2 Portfolios FAQ 20.1.2.2.1 ‚ÄúI am curious about the format of portfolio and assessment and how they will be conducted.‚Äù 2022-01-12: More info over the next two weeks, but these will be a lot like a traditional assignment, but with a writing task (the module writing tasks are good indicators and practice) and some additional narrative about what you‚Äôre learning/demonstrating. You‚Äôll submit commented code in an Rmd and the associated PDF. 20.1.2.3 Mixed assessments FAQ 20.1.2.3.1 ‚ÄúHow does the mixed assessment work? Is it like a midterm?‚Äù Mostly, except there will also be a small amount of pre-work. More information closer too, but the overall goal is to make it more real-world. When you prep for a big meeting in the real world, you might calculate some summary stats, have a few basic plots ready, have some notes, etc. Sure, there are some things where you‚Äôll have to think it through in the moment (in the mixed assessment and in the real world), but I hope having the untimed pre-work helps lessen some of the test anxiety folks can feel. Less mind reading, more targeted prep. 20.1.2.3.2 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between mini and mixed assessments? Are they both term tests?‚Äù One is bigger and one is smaller. ;) But yeah, the mini has one 50 minute timed component while the main mixed assessment will have more pre-work and two 50 minute timed parts. 20.1.2.3.3 Will we get some sample practice problems to work on before the mini-mixed and mixed assessments? The ‚Äòmini‚Äô is effectively practice problems for the main, but Team Up!s will also be useful practice for the mixed assessments. If there isn‚Äôt a Team Up! (which you‚Äôve be able to review asynchronously for study purposes) for a module I‚Äôll offer a practice quiz (no points) option or other practice activity. 20.1.2.3.4 ‚ÄúWhat exactly will we do in assessment weeks?‚Äù There is no new content or writing module. They are a time to focus your 6‚Äì8 hours of weekly STA303 time on the assessment. Mixed: doing the pre-work and the 100 minute (2 x 50) timed component. Project week: working with your group/self, asking questions in office hours. The expectation is that you‚Äôll start the project well before then, but I know the end of the semester can be stressful and busy, so I‚Äôm making things as simple and focused for you as I can. 20.1.2.4 Final project FAQ 20.1.2.4.1 ‚ÄúWhat kind of activities will the final project entail?‚Äù More details before reading week, but you will receive data and a client brief and be asked to create a written report that includes an executive summary as well as a more technical report. 20.1.2.5 Assessments: General FAQ 20.1.2.5.1 ‚ÄúHow we can choose path A or B for the marking scheme‚Äì would this be on Quercus?‚Äù As long as you‚Äôre okay with getting the higher of the two marks, I‚Äôll calculate your grade both ways and give you the higher one. 20.1.2.5.2 ‚ÄúSo are all assessment due on Thursday 3:03?‚Äù Almost all the big ones! The mixed assessments have a window, but professional development proposal, professional development evidence &amp; reflection, mini-portfolio, portfolio and project are all due on a Thursday at 3:03 p.m. 20.1.2.5.3 ‚ÄúAre we allowed to answer assignments with programming languages other than R?‚Äù This is an R-based course, so only coding assessments using R will be accepted. 20.1.2.5.4 ‚ÄúWhat are the minimum requirements to pass the course?‚Äù 50% overall, no special conditions. 20.1.3 Team Up! 20.1.3.1 Troubleshooting &amp; FAQ advice from U of T CTSI Link to student facing Quercus Support resources. 20.1.3.1.1 ‚ÄúMy screen seems to be lagging compared to those of my group members (e.g., I‚Äôm not on the same question as the driver/members, the answer I chose does not appear on my group members‚Äô screens, etc.)‚Äù As long as you are logged in, you will receive your grade, so just continue to participate by communicating with your team. Almost always, your device will re-sync with the rest of your team‚Äôs devices within a minute or two. If not, refresh your screen once. Repeatedly refreshing is not usually helpful! 20.1.3.1.2 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been disconnected. Will my quiz progress be saved? Can I re-join my group?‚Äù Enter the Team Up! session again and you will automatically be put back into your group. Your progress will be saved, and you will return to the question you or your group was working on. This is true for the Driver as well as any team member. 20.1.3.1.3 ‚ÄúHow do I send my completed quiz results?‚Äù Click the large red ‚ÄúSubmit to Quercus‚Äù button at the end of the Team Up! quiz. 20.1.3.1.4 ‚ÄúCan we change our group driver?‚Äù You can request a driver change by pressing the red exclamation mark in the top right of your Team Up! quiz. 20.1.3.1.5 ‚ÄúHow is the driver for our group chosen, and how can the driver pass the group ID to others in remote classes?‚Äù Group members can decide who will be the Driver (ideally someone with a good internet connection). The Driver can pass the group ID to other members verbally through chat or microphone in breakout rooms. 20.1.3.1.6 ‚ÄúThe Driver of my group has to leave unexpectedly or their device has stopped functioning. How do we proceed with the quiz?‚Äù Request for a Driver Change using the red button at the top right of your Team Up! Session. This button only provides help for Driver Changes. You may also need to speak with your instructor or TA. 20.2 Other 20.2.1 References 20.2.1.0.1 ‚ÄúCan you (Prof. Bolton) write me a reference?‚Äù Please read my personal policy here to get a sense of under what circumstances I could write for you, but basically, a good mark in one class is not sufficient and you need to have at least two ‚Äòactivities‚Äô with me. If you believe you meet my basic criteria, you can request a reference from me here. I will then accept or decline based on the the information provided. 20.2.1.0.2 ‚ÄúDo you (Prof. Bolton) have any research opportunities available?‚Äù Research/work study/teaching assistant opportunities: See the Department website. The main round of TA recruitment occurs during the summer but there are occasionally emergency postings. Some information about opportunities with me on my website. Reading courses: STA496/497: Readings in Statistics must be registered for as part of special enrolment during July. I will not be taking on any further students. If you‚Äôre thinking about the future, I usually consider taking on a small number of STA497 students for a half-credit, year long version. There is much more information about my past students, research interests and what a course with me might be like on my website: &lt;https://www.lizabolton.com/reading_courses.html&gt;. 20.3 Errata ID Location Note 1 Module 1 Team Up!

If the number of columns = the rank of the matrix all the columns are linearly independent. If the umber of columns is &gt; the rank of the matrix, all the columns are not linearly independent. You can only invert a square matrix if all its columns are linearly independent. (Determinant non-zero). Why do we care? In linear regression, to estimate \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\), our vector of coefficients, we calculate \\((\\boldsymbol X^T\\boldsymbol X)^{-1}\\boldsymbol X^T\\boldsymbol Y\\). The elements of \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\) can‚Äôt be estimated if \\(\\boldsymbol X^T\\boldsymbol X\\) (a square matrix) isn‚Äôt invertible. Clarification to what I said in the tests activity: We usually perform regression with an intercept because we don‚Äôt want to assume out line passes through the origin, 0. So, if there is an intercept, (column of 1s in the model matrix) we must convert every categorical variable with \\(k\\) levels into \\(k-1\\) dummy variables to have the intercept and still satisfies linear independence. IF we ditch the intercept, we can have k dummies, but this is only usually useful in the specific case of ANOVA. 21.2.2 Example ## # A tibble: 12 √ó 2 ## # Groups: species [3] ## body_mass_g species ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 3900 Adelie ## 2 3700 Adelie ## 3 3450 Adelie ## 4 3175 Adelie ## 5 4500 Chinstrap ## 6 3850 Chinstrap ## 7 3650 Chinstrap ## 8 4550 Chinstrap ## 9 5150 Gentoo ## 10 5000 Gentoo ## 11 5700 Gentoo ## 12 4600 Gentoo ## # A tibble: 12 √ó 4 ## body_mass_g species.Adelie species.Chinstrap species.Gentoo ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3900 1 0 0 ## 2 3700 1 0 0 ## 3 3450 1 0 0 ## 4 3175 1 0 0 ## 5 4500 0 1 0 ## 6 3850 0 1 0 ## 7 3650 0 1 0 ## 8 4550 0 1 0 ## 9 5150 0 0 1 ## 10 5000 0 0 1 ## 11 5700 0 0 1 ## 12 4600 0 0 1 21.2.2.1 Classic regression, k-1 dummies (intercept) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ species, data = pengwings) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -512.50 -310.94 -34.37 348.44 587.50 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

AS Note-taking Team 22.0.2 Looking for student representatives for STA303 Our course is part of a small pilot of student representative pilot for the Department of Statistical Sciences and I am looking for two undergraduate student representatives to work with me to represent our course. (STA1002 students, there isn‚Äôt a grad version of this, but you can also provide feedback to these reps and I encourage you to also reach out to me directly!) Student representatives work with their instructor to solicit and respond to student feedback throughout the semester. Representatives talk with their instructors about how the course is going, provide feedback to the department about student needs more generally and learn about department resources so that they can help connect students to these, as relevant. You can learn more about the experience from previous reps here. 22.0.2.1 The role of a student representative Once a rep is selected, they will: Attend a mandatory training session. Have their email made available to the class on Quercus so students can contact them. They may also introduce themselves in a synchronous class, or write a small blurb for an announcement or create a pre-recorded video. This is up to the student/instructor team. Reach out to students to elicit feedback. Additional tasks (e.g., helping with optional student pulse surveys or organising study groups or class events, etc.) would be left to the discretion of the student representative and instructor (they are not a required part of the program). Keep in regular contact with the instructor as issues or concerns arise. 22.0.2.2 Benefits of being a student representative Being part of creating a great learning experience for themselves and others. Networking with other students and members of the Department. Opportunities to work closely with an instructor that may mean they could be a strong referee for you and/or lead to taking a reading course with them etc. A chance to demonstrate and improve communication, leadership, and organisational skills. Something to put on a CV. 22.0.2.3 How to become a rep If you are eligible (see below), you can put yourself forward via this form. Please make sure you choose the correct section, where applicable! Student representatives for each section will be selected via lottery from the eligible students that have expressed interest by Monday, January 24 at 6:00 p.m. ET. 22.0.2.4 Eligibility criteria You will need to be available to attend an online training, 11:10 a.m.‚Äì12:00 p.m. ET on Friday, 28 January 2022. You must be enrolled in the section you put yourself forward for. You don‚Äôt have to be enrolled in a DoSS program to put yourself forward for the role, though it may be of more interest/use to you if you are. PDF version of below ad here. "]]
