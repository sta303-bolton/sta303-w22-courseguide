You will be asked: if they have met the submission requirements, to rate them on the rubric, to make a short comment about a strength of this piece of writing, to make a short comment about a way this piece of writing could be improved. 5.0.3 Reflect phase The Reflect phase is due second Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET Read the feedback received from your peers. Rate the usefulness on a 3-point scale. 5.0.4 General instructions These assessments can be used to make up your knowledge basket. They are also useful in helping you prepare for your portfolio writing samples and final project writing. Warning: MAKE SURE YOU CLICK SUBMIT! Check that each phase is showing as submitted. Students have occasionally struggled with this in peerScholar’s interface and no regrades/adjustments will be possible after the fact. Your mark for this assessment will be based on participation. There will be separate marks for each phase, i.e., you can get part marks overall. 45% for completing create, 45% for completing assess, 10% for completing reflect. Please note that participation not in the spirit of the assessment (e.g. just putting the Lorem Ipsum text, or giving feedback like “write better” and nothing else) will not get you marks. 5.1 Module 1 writing task Information Note Name Module 1 writing task Type (Main, Mini or Basket) Basket Value 0.5% (0.2%-0.2%-0.1%) Completion Due Create phase: Friday, January 14, 2022 at 3:03 p.m ET; Assess phase: Tuesday, January 18, 2022 at 3:03 p.m ET; Reflect phase: Friday, January 21, 2022 at 3:03 p.m ET; Submission instructions Submission: Via peerScholar Untimed survey, marked for completion Late submissions, accommodations, and extension policy No late submissions, accommodations, or extensions. 5.1.1 Instructions 5.1.1.1 Prompt Discuss what you consider the most important dos and don’ts when giving peer feedback.
