University of Toronto, Department of Statistical Sciences STA303/1002: Methods of Data Analysis II 2.1 Course information 2022 HALF YEAR, HALF CREDIT 2.1.1 Course description The course focuses on using and interpreting advanced statistical methods with applications in a number of different areas. The overall theme of this course is dealing with situations where the assumptions of the regression models developed in STA302 may not apply. The course is a mixture of theory and application. Assignments will involve computing with R and there is a significant focus on written and oral communication. 2.1.2 Class times Class: Wednesdays L0101: 10:00 a.m.—12:00 p.m. ET L0201: 3:00 p.m.—5:00 p.m. ET Tutorials: Alternating Thursdays 12:00 p.m.—1:00 p.m. ET or 5:00 p.m.—6:00 p.m. ET Delivery Wednesday classes will be online and recorded. The Thursday tutorial time will alternate between group activities and TA office hours. They will be online for January, and an optional in-person stream for the fortnightly group activities is planned after that. Synchronous attendance is recommended but not required to complete the course. 2.1.3 Materials All materials will be posted on Quercus and/or the course guide. Course discussion board: Piazza 2.1.4 Teaching team 2.1.4.1 Instructor Liza Bolton Pronouns: she/her Email: sta303@utoronto.ca Office hours: 2nd half of Wednesday classes Please call me: Liza or Prof. Bolton/Prof. B How do you pronounce that? Liza: a video… Bolton: like the words “bowl” + “tonne” 2.1.4.2 Head TA Amin Banihashemi (he/him) Please call me: Amin (A-meen [æˈmiːn or əˈmiːn] [bæniːˈhɑːʃɛmiː] decode here) Email: sta303@utoronto.ca 2.1.4.3 Teaching assistants Vedant Choudhary, Shuang Di, Sonia Markes, Ian Richter, Xiaochuan Shi, Lei Sun, Liam Welsh, Dongyang Yang, Kevin Zhang, Robert Zimmerman Office hours: Alternating Thursdays, see Quercus Email: sta303@utoronto.ca 2.2 Land acknowledgment The land on which our University operates is the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. With the Dish With One Spoon treaty, these peoples agreed to share and protect this land, and all those who have come here since, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, are invited into this treaty in a spirit of respect and peace. This land is also, more recently, subject to Treaty 13, a treaty between the Mississaugas and the British Crown. In this course, we are coming together to discuss statistics, a field that has been part of historical and ongoing colonization, oppression, and harm of Indigenous peoples. Let us remind ourselves of our responsibilities to this land, its original peoples, and to each other and work to be ethical and culturally competent practitioners in our chosen fields. We encourage you to consider the history of the land wherever you are. https://www.whose.land/en/ 2.3 Prerequisites STA302/1001 I.e., we will assume that you are familiar with running linear regression analyses, including checking assumptions and some of the mathematical reasoning behind the models. Material from the second-year statistical theory courses which are prerequisites to STA302 will be drawn on extensively. Knowledge of programming with R is essential. 2.4 Course format and organization This course is composed of five two-week modules and two assessment focus weeks. Each module has an “I show you, you show me” structure. It starts with you watching videos and/or doing readings and a guided code demonstration or other relevant class topics (“I show you”). This course is flipped, so the expectation is that you engage with some or all of the asynchronous content before Wednesday in the first week. Then you will do some or all of the following: a group problem-solving activity, practice quizzes, assessment activities. During assessment focus weeks, no new content will be released. 2.5 Learning objectives By the end of the course, you will be able to: Wrangle and explore a dataset Create appropriate data visualizations Describe ethical considerations in data analysis Understand the assumptions and appropriate use cases for linear mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models, and generalized additive models Write and execute R code for the model types covered Accurately and appropriately interpret the results of the model types covered and communicate these to a range of audiences 2.6 Textbooks You do not have to purchase a textbook for this course. There are three texts that we will use extensively, and they are all freely available to you. Additional readings will be assigned as appropriate. Wickham. R for Data Science. 2019. Legler and Roback. Broadening Your Statistical Horizons. 2019. Wood. Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R, 2nd Edition. 2017. (requires you to log in with your UTORid) 2.7 Computing and minimum technical requirements We will be using RStudio to make reproducible data analysis reports using R and R Markdown. You can use RStudio on your personal machine or through the U of T JupyterHub: jupyter.utoronto.ca. To participate in synchronous classes and office hours you will need a U of T Zoom account. If you do not yet have one, go to https://utoronto.zoom.us/ to set one up. To participate fully, you will need Desktop client or mobile app: version 5.3.0 or higher or ChromeOS: version 5.0.0 (4241.1207) or higher. You can check your desktop client or mobile app version by following these instructions. All students should consult the minimum technical requirements for participation in online learning. If you are facing financial barriers to obtaining the required technology, please contact your College Registrar’s Office to obtain information regarding your potential eligibility for a need-based bursary. 2.8 Course outline The topics listed below are subject to change.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood1: You can opt for Path A or Path B to get your final mark. I will calculate your marks along both paths and then assign you the higher of the two as your final mark. (Grad students have a third option) A-tisket, a-tasket2, fill up your knowledge basket3: Personalize which of these assessments you do based on your interests and skills you want to develop. You can ‘max out’ your basket: just keep putting grades in until you get to 5%. Assessment Path A Path B STA1002 ONLY Due dates Mini-portfolio 5 0 0 Feb 3 Portfolio 20 25 25 Feb 7 Mini-mixed assessment 5 0 0 Mar 9 (12-hour assessment window, 8:00 a.m.–8:00 p.m. ET) Mixed assessment 20 25 25 Mar 16 (12-hour assessment window, 8:00 a.m.–8:00 p.m. ET) Final project 45 45 50 Apr 7 (2% pt bonus) | Apr 11 (no bonus) Knowledge basket 5 5 0 Multiple Total 100 100 100 Everything4 in STA303 is due at 3:03 p.m. ET Note: All times in this course are in Eastern Time (Toronto time). Please note that daylight savings will begin in Canada on March 13. If you are not based in Canada this may change the time conversion for you. Please keep this in mind. 2.9.1 Knowledge basket The following components are guaranteed knowledge basket assessment options. Additional opportunities may be offered throughout the course (Team Up!, speaker series reflections, etc.) Assessment % Due date Pre-knowledge check: completion 0.5 Jan 20 Pre-knowledge check: 80%+ or workshop 0.5 Jan 20 (80%+ score) | Feb 2 (workshop) Professional development task proposal 1 Feb 3 Professional development task evidence &amp; reflection 3 Mar 31 Writing &amp; peer review (Create-Assess-Reflect) x 5 0.5 X 5 Friday-Tuesday-Friday each Module Module check-in x 5 0.1 X 5 Last Friday of each Module 2.10 Hours expectations While everyone has different work styles and learning needs, I want to provide some guidance around how I expect this course to look for you. Plan to be doing 6–8 hours of work on STA303 each week. In a two-week module, this may look like: 2–4 hours on videos and readings 1–3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities 1–2 hours on knowledge basket assessments 2–6 hours on other assessments Remaining time attending reading announcements, office hours, checking Piazza, revision, etc. 2.11 Marking concerns / regrade requests Any request to have an assessment remarked must be submitted to the appropriate form on the Forms page on Quercus under the following conditions: Wait 24 hours after the release of grades. Use this time to go over any sample solutions and feedback, the instructions, and relevant course materials. After the 24-hour period has finished, you will have one week to submit your regrade request. (I.e., one week + 24 hours total.) Your request must include a detailed and thoughtful justification referring to your answer and the relevant course material to be considered. Please note that I reserve the right to review the grading of all questions or parts when you re-submit an assessment for reconsideration (i.e., your grade could go down). You will receive a confirmation email upon submitting the form. Allow for two weeks for processing after the request window closes before following up. The specific timeline and requirements for final project regrade requests will be announced later. Only answers in English (or appropriate code, mathematical symbols) can be accepted in this course. Answers submitted in a different language will receive a 0 and will not be eligible for regrading. If you have an autotranslation extension on your browser, be very careful about how this can interact with Quercus. Please note that I reserve the right to review the grading of all questions or parts when you re-submit an assessment for reconsideration (i.e., your grade could go down). 2.12 Missed work policies In general, late work is not accepted, without either: an extension requested 48 hours before the due date, or a personal illness/emergency declaration no more than 3 days after the due date. Please note that technical difficulties knitting an Rmd or getting the due time wrong do not constitute personal emergencies. The following assessments are eligible: Mini-portfolio Portfolio Mini-mixed assessment Mixed assessment Professional development proposal Professional development evidence and reflection Upon receipt of your request, we will contact you via email within 2 business days to confirm an accommodation, as appropriate. 2.12.1 Exceptions Knowledge basket assessments (other than the professional development task components) are not eligible for extensions. There are no routine extensions granted for the final project. In exceptional circumstances, you can work with your College Registrar and me on this. 2.12.2 IMPORTANT NOTES If too much work is missed, even for valid reasons, an oral exam may be required to calculate a fair mark, at the discretion of the instructor. Please ensure you and/or your College Registrar get in touch with me as early as possible if this may be the case for you. If you have accommodation letters from an accessibility advisor, make sure you read the instructions in the ‘Accommodations and accessibility’ section. Unless discussed with your instructor first and an agreement is come to, if you submit an assessment, it will be assumed that you deemed yourself fit enough to do so and your grade will stand as calculated. No accommodation will be made based on claims of medical, physical, or emotional distress after the fact. 2.13 Communication policy AKA How to get your questions answered Following our course communication policy helps ensure you receive answers and supports in a timely fashion, and also shows respect for the teaching team’s time and effort. We reserve the right to ignore any correspondence that does not conform to this policy. Course logistics? e.g., - What is the deadline for the final project? - Where do I submit the assignment? Course content? e.g., - Why do we sometimes use glm() and sometimes use glmer()? - My code won’t run for question #1 Info to share with class? e.g., - I have a link/resource/opportunity to share with my classmates PIAZZA FORUM Link in Quercus’ course navigation menu. Posts can be anonymous for your classmates, but instructors and TAs will be able to see your name. Before posting a question, double-check the syllabus AND search to see if someone else has already asked a similar question (you can edit the question to add yours or post a follow-up at the bottom). - Try to answer your classmates’ questions—this is a great way to reinforce your own understanding while also helping your classmates! Don’t worry if you aren’t 100% sure of the answer—answers will be reviewed/endorsed/completed by the teaching team! Missed an assessment due to illness or personal emergency? Want to request a regrade of an assessment? FORMS Use the appropriate form linked on the Forms page on Quercus. If you cannot meet a deadline because you are ill, please also refer to the Missed Work section in this syllabus. A doctor’s note is not required, but if you have one you can upload it as supporting documentation. If you wish to request a regrade, please also refer to the Marking Concerns section in this syllabus. Be prepared to provide a detailed justification and possible supplementary materials. “I worked hard on this so I should get a better mark” is not an appropriate justification (yes, I do receive emails like that). Personal/sensitive circumstances? (i.e., something which is not appropriate to share with the whole class) COURSE EMAIL: sta303@utoronto.ca Send emails from your utoronto.ca email address to ensure they don’t automatically go to a Junk folder. Include your full name and UTORid. This account will be monitored by the head TA and course instructor; if you want to reach Prof. Bolton only please include [Prof. Bolton] in the subject line; do not email her directly about course matters. Allow at least 24 hours for a response during the week (Monday to Friday, ET) and do not expect responses on the weekend. Do not send a follow-up email until at least two business days (Toronto time) later. NEVER send Quercus mail to the STA303 teaching team. NEVER use the ‘Add Comment’ option on Quercus. They will not read. Please.  2.14 Accommodations and accessibility If you have an accommodation letter from your accessibility advisor that is relevant to this course, please do the following: Email your letter to sta303@utoronto.ca with “Accommodation letter” as part of the email subject, CC your advisor and let us know anything else you wish us to know/any questions you have. Please do this as soon as possible after you enroll in the course/receive this syllabus. Confirm any accommodations for each specific assessment one week before the assessment. (I.e., if you receive extra time for timed assessments, confirm this one week prior to the mixed assessments, even if we have already discussed this at the beginning of the semester.) 2.14.1 Accessibility services The University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations for a disability or have any accessibility concerns about the course or course materials, please contact Accessibility Services as soon as possible: email accessibility.services@utoronto.ca or visit the website at &lt;http://accessibility.utoronto.ca&gt;. 2.14.2 Religious Accommodation At the University of Toronto, we are part of a diverse community of students, staff, and faculty from a wide range of cultural and religious traditions. For this course, I have sought to avoid scheduling compulsory activities in ways that will clash with religious holy days (not captured by statutory holidays). If you anticipate missing a course activity due to a religious observance, please let me know as early in the course as possible. With sufficient notice—ideally at least three weeks—we can work together to make alternate arrangements. 2.15 Recognized study groups I would highly recommend you get involved with an RSG. RSGs are small study groups of 3 to 6 students from the same course who meet weekly to learn course content in a collaborative environment. 2.16 Meet to complete Meet to Complete is an online “study with me” space where you can study alongside other students. To join Meet to Complete, enroll in the Meet to Complete course on Quercus. Learning, even online, doesn’t need to be lonely! 2.17 Feeling distressed? You may find yourself feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or anxious. Lots of people feel the same way. There is help available from mental health professionals 24 hours a day via online and phone-based services listed on this page in the course guide, as well as a range of other helpful U of T and community resources. Accessibility Services (see above) also provides supports for mental health concerns. 2.18 Intellectual property statement Course material that has been created by your instructor (i.e., lecture slides, questions/solutions, and any other course material and resources made available to you) is the intellectual property of your instructor (or the credited holder of the copyright) and is made available to you for your personal use in this course. Sharing, posting, selling or using this material outside of your personal use in this course is not permitted under any circumstances and is considered an infringement of intellectual property rights. If you would like to record any course activities in this course, you MUST ask permission from your instructor in advance. According to intellectual property laws, not asking permission constitutes stealing. 2.19 Academic integrity 2.19.1 Plagiarism You may be at risk of plagiarizing if you do not understand the rules and your responsibilities. You must not present the work of others as your own. This includes, but is certainly not limited to, copying text and including it in your writing without a citation and quotation marks. There are many resources to help you learn more: https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/perils-and-pitfalls/ https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/smart-strategies/ This video will be assigned later in the course. YOU are responsible for knowing the content of the University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. The University of Toronto treats cases of academic misconduct very seriously. Academic integrity is a fundamental value of learning and scholarship at the U of T. Participating honestly, respectfully, responsibly, and fairly in this academic community ensures that your U of T degree is valued and respected as a true signifier of your individual academic achievement. Other potential offences include, but are not limited to: Looking at someone else’s answers. Letting someone else look at your answers. Misrepresenting your identity. Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University. Falsifying institutional documents or grades. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following the procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please do not hesitate to contact me. 2.19.2 Specific advice on untimed assessments As a general rule, for untimed assessments, I encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice. However, it is not permitted to share R code or written answers for anything that is to be handed in. For example, “For question 2 what R function did you use?” is a fair question when discussing course material with others in the class; “Please show me your R code for question 2” is not an appropriate question. If writing or code is discovered to match another student’s submission or outside source, this will be reported as an academic offense. When asked to hand in code and the output it creates, the code you submit must have been used to generate the document. If it does not (i.e., the submitted code does not match the submitted output), this is also considered an academic offense. 2.19.3 Rules for timed assessments (e.g., mixed assessments) While all timed assessments in this course are open-book, they are not “open-person.” You MUST NOT discuss any details of the assessment with anyone else during the assessment window, regardless of your completion status. This includes, but is not limited to, current classmates, friends, and tutors. For example, even asking someone “which slide did you look at to answer question 3” is not appropriate for timed assessments. 2.19.4 NOTE: BE CAREFUL ABOUT PRIVATE TUTORING COMPANIES You may have been contacted by private tutoring companies trying to sell their services to you for statistics courses. Please be extremely careful with these services as some forms of tutoring can pose an academic offence risk. A good tutor helps you understand the subject area and supports your learning. A good tutor does not give you answers. There are no shortcuts to learning. Learning takes time and effort. Be cautious about giving money to companies whose motivation is profit. They may tell you they have ‘insider information.’ They don’t. They may even offer you the opportunity to commit academic offenses. Please do not put your University of Toronto education at risk by participating in these kinds of unacceptable behaviours. If you have any questions or concerns about what is okay and what is not in your course, please ask! 2.20 Course design principles Here are some of the principles around which I have designed this course. I hope they might provide some useful insight into why some things are the way they are, and help you think about how to navigate this course and make the best of it. The teaching team really wants you to have a great time in this course, learn lots of delicious statistics, and become confident, competent, and useful statistical thinkers. Please approach us and this course with an open mind and help us make it a good experience for you by providing thoughtful, constructive feedback. 2.20.1 Humans learn better ‘little and often’ but everyone is burnout from two years of a pandemic I know some students absolutely hate weekly tasks and how common they have become with online learning, and that all the little tasks and deadlines can become overwhelming. I also know that cramming is the absolute worst way to learn and actually retain that learning. This is why in this course: I have taken things out or made them baskets options, based on student feedback There is a knowledge basket that lets you approach frequent low-stakes practice in the way that suits you best and aims to facilitate and reward spaced repetition, the way science says is the best way to learn (this free course is fantastic for learning more about how to learn). Has been converted to have a two-week module structure to give you more flexibility. Has two assessments pathways with different numbers of assessments. 2.20.2 Writing is good for statisticians Writing not only helps you explain yourself to others, it can also be a fulfilling act of creative personal expression and a way to clarify your own understanding of a concept. Writing is an important part of this course because it is an important skill for your future careers/next steps in education. Lots of support and information here: &lt;https://writing.utoronto.ca/&gt;. 2.20.3 Course content is Accessible My intention is to make this course accessible as possible with captions for all video and audio and Quercus/course guide design that is easy for folks using screen readers to navigate. If there is something I could do differently in this area that would make your life easier and you’re comfortable to tell me, please do! One thing I know isn’t great but, regretfully, don’t have the resources to change, is the ‘quality assurance’ of the autogenerated captions for videos. Please reach out on Piazza if you’re ever unsure about something they say. The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost.

We’re excited you’re joining us on this statistical voyage. I look forward to introducing myself to you in our first class on Wednesday, but for now, there is are basic introductions below for me and our Head TA Amin. Feel free to skip to How this course works, I know there is a lot to read in the module! Looking forward to a great semester! See you in class on Wednesday. 3.1.1 Professor Liza Bolton, Instructor Email: sta303@utoronto.ca (Put “[Prof. Bolton]” in the subject line to the email me directly) Pronouns: she/her Before moving (back) to Canada in 2019, I had lived more than half my life in New Zealand. (I still mention New Zealand a lot in class…) My current research areas are in statistics education and online learning, as well as health disparities across ethnic groups. I used to run a small consulting company and called myself a Data Ambassador. Why? Well, lots of people are consultants. I even did an internship in management consulting once upon a time. But it wasn’t a satisfying title for what I wanted my work with people to look like. I wanted something that focused on the communication and interpersonal side, not just high quality and appropriate analysis. People who aren’t confident in their ability to analyse their own data need a go-between, someone who can be an ambassador for their data! While I don’t do consulting any more, I love helping students build their technical and professional skills so they can go out into the world and be excellent ambassadors for data themselves. Last movie I cried in: Kiki’s Delivery Service Favourite food: Corn. Popped, on the cob, in a chip, Mmmmm. Book most often given as a gift: A Matter of Fact: Talking Truth in a Post-Truth World by Jess Berentson-Shaw 3.1.2 Amin Banihashemi, Head TA Email: sta303@utoronto.ca (Amin will often be the one responding to your emails) Pronouns: he/him I’m a fourth-year PhD student at the Institute of Medical Science. I have been a TA for STA130 in DoSS for the past 3 years and this is my second semester as Head TA of STA303. My area of research is clinical Neuroscience, something I am passionate about. I analyze images of brain and eye structures in neurodegenerative diseases. I investigate possible associations of these structures with each other and with the ability to remember well and carry out goal-oriented tasks successfully. I love creating reproducible statistical analysis workflows in R. I also like audiobooks, candlelight, and apple pie (which I make myself!) 3.2 A few things to know upfront R is the programming language used in this course. I use and teach a lot of tidyverse, especially dplyr for data wrangling and ggplot for visualization. If you’re not familiar with these, consider getting ahead by checking out: chapters 3 and 5 of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham &amp; Garret Grolemund, and the DoSS Toolkit, especially the modules ‘Hand me my plyrs’ and To ggplot or not to ggplot. The entire course is online until Jan 31. While some elements of the delivery of STA303 may be in person after that, the course will have a large online component regardless and all assessments will be able to be completed and submitted online. If you are enrolled in an in-person tutorial, you will have an option to attend online instead. Synchronous attendance is NOT required to pass this course, but being able to attend (online) synchronously at the times in the timetable may make things easier for you. I cannot add students to a course, waive prerequisites or move them off a waitlist. If you or a friend have any questions of this nature, please reach out to the UG stats team (ug.statistics@utoronto.ca). Waitlisted STA303 students may access course materials by filling out this form, but they will not be able to complete assessments during this time. The course is designed to accommodate this. Check out my autoresponder message post for FAQs and other useful information. 3.2.1 Students joining off the waitlist You do not have to submit any assessments you missed while on the waitlist. They are all knowledge basket assessments and you will have multiple future opportunities to make up those grades. See the Syllabus for more information. If you have a friend on the waitlist, they can sign up to receive materials here. 3.3 How this course works This course is organized into five two-week modules of learning + two one-week assessment-focus weeks. All course material will be made available through this course guide and/or in Quercus. All times listed are ‘Toronto time,’ i.e. Eastern Time. Note that Daylight Savings Time begins Sunday, March 13, 2022.

A synchronous class on Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. ET (L0101) and 3:00 p.m. ET (L0201). Both sessions will be the same, you only need to attend one. You must be logged in with your U of T Zoom account (utoronto.zoom.us) to access the class. Synchronous classes will be recorded. You’re expected to watch the recording if you cannot attend live. They will be posted on the course overview page. A knowledge basket writing task. Create phase due first Friday at 3:03 p.m. ET. Assess phase due second Tuesday at 3:03 p.m. ET. Reflect phase due second Friday at 3:03 p.m. ET. Office hours. Prof office hours will occur during the second half of the Wednesday synchronous classes, i.e. approximately 11:10–12:00 p.m ET and 4:10–5:00 p.m., in the same Zoom call. TA office hours will take place during the Thursday tutorial times (12:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. ET) on the second Thursday of each module. 3.4 Hours expectations While everyone has different work styles and learning needs, I want to provide some guidance around how I expect this course to look for students. Plan to be doing 6–8 hours of work on STA303 each week. In a two-week module, this may be comprised of: 2–4 hours on videos and readings 1–3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities 1–2 hours on knowledge basket assessments 2–6 hours on other assessments Remaining time attending reading announcements, office hours, checking Piazza, revision, etc. 3.4.1 Communication Our course discussion board on Piazza is to be used for all content and administration questions. Only sensitive or personal issues/questions should be sent to sta303@utoronto.ca. We reserve the right not to respond to emails that should be Piazza posts. Please ensure all course-related emails include your UTORID. There are several important forms that you may need if you miss an assessment due to illness or emergency or wish to request a regrade of an assessment. I will use Quercus announcements to share course information and updates. Please make sure you read these. I may also occasionally email or Quercus message you about things that relate specifically to you. 3.5 To do now Read the Syllabus (pdf version here) Join the Piazza discussion board. Understand the tools we will be using in this course. Learn about some of the services and supports available to you as a U of T student. Make sure you have a U of T Zoom account, https://utoronto.zoom.us/. Update it if needed, see more here. "],["assessmentsoverview.html", "4 Assessment overview 4.1 Graduate student modification (1002H)", " 4 Assessment overview There are two special elements of assessment/grade calculation in this course that are important to be aware of in planning your approach to it.

Extensions may be requested through the same form up to 48 hours before the due date. Portfolio assessments aim to help you demonstrate your technical coding, statistical thinking, communication and reflection skills. This mini-portfolio also aims to recap and refresh knowledge from your previous statistics courses as well as building your ability to create quality data visualizations. 5.1 General instructions Be very careful to follow instructions on variable naming. If you do not, your code won’t pass autograding and you will not receive the grades. This will not be eligible for regrading requests. Comment your code! In an R code chunk comments start with a # (pound sign or hashtag symbol). Don’t confuse this with the use of # to denote different levels of headings in the text parts (governed by Markdown syntax) of an R Markdown document. You should neatly format your code. No strict style is required, but make sure it is easy to read your work. (Optional) You may find Google’s R Style Guide or the Tidyverse Style Guide interesting. DO include your code in the body of the PDF itself (don’t set echo=FALSE, don’t hide/suppress etc.). Note that this is different to what you will be asked to do in the final project or in professional reporting. This is a demonstration of your skills. If asked to write and answer in words, write in full sentences. KNIT EARLY AND OFTEN! Don’t leave things till the last minute, your Rmd not knitting is not an emergency for which an extension will be granted. 5.1.1 Template You can access the template for this assessment here. There is currently a lot of ‘filler text’ and ‘filler code’ in the template that you will want to delete. Fun fact: All filler text sourced from Hipster Ipsum, which Katy Wang in the UG Stats office introduced me to. 5.2 Submission instructions Submit both your Rmd (must be called: sta303-w22-mini-portfolio.Rmd) and PDF (must be called: sta303-w22-mini-portfolio.pdf) on MarkUs. You do not need to submit any data or tex files. 5.3 Cover page You don’t have to use the provided template, but you DO need to write your mini-portfolio in RMarkdown and include a cover page. The cover page must have: A title and subtitle (you can use my examples in the template or update them as you see fit, no points for changing, but it might make it a better part of your own website or GitHUb portfolio, in the future) Your name Date (assessment submission date is fine) In the template, you can change the colour of this cover to any colour you would like by replacing 6C3082 in the YAML (line 11) to another hex code. You could use this tool to help you: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/ 5.4 Introduction Write this section last or second to last (before the refection). In the introduction section, write a brief summary of the skills you have demonstrated in this mini-portfolio, across the statistical skills sample, writing sample and reflection sections. Think of it like a cover letter for this document. It should be appropriate for a fairly general audience—imagine a future employer reading this. You may want to briefly explain the course context, as you understand it. What is STA303/1002 about? (Consider the learning objectives in the syllabus) Your introduction should be no longer than 300 words and must fit on one page. 5.5 Statistical skills sample 5.5.1 Task 1: Setting up libraries Set up a chunk called setup where you load the tidyverse and readxl libraries. Set your chunk options to message=FALSE so all the package loading information isn’t included in your our output. You will need to make sure you run this chunk each time you start a new session so you can use many of the functions required. 5.5.2 Task 2: Visualizing the variance of a Binomial random variable for varying proportions Goal: Show visually that for a fixed value of \\(n\\), \\(p=0.5\\) will result in the largest variance for a Binomial random variable. Choose two appropriate values of \\(n&gt;0\\) for your demonstration and save them as n1 and n2 Create a vector of proportions, props, from 0 to 1, in steps of 0.01 (Tip: use the seq() function). If I suggest a function you haven’t seen before, you can search its documentation in your console by typing a ? in front of the function name, e.g. ?seq. Create a tibble (a data type in R, like a dataframe), for_plot, with the vector of props as the first variable, and two additional variables calculating the variance for each of your two chosen n values. (Call these n1_var and n2_var) Create two plots, one for each of your values of \\(n\\), using ggplot and apply theme_minimal() to each one. These should appear in your PDF and do not need to be saved with specific name. Add an appropriate figure caption to each chart (use fig.cap=“Your text here” in the R chunk settings). An appropriate title should succinctly explain the chart and mention the chosen n value. Add a caption within the ggplot that says “Created by STUDENT NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022.” Give the x and y labels appropriate labels. 5.5.2.1 Objects that must be carefully assigned to pass autograding n1 and n2 (both should be integer vectors of length 1) props, a numeric vector for_plot, a tibble with three correctly named columns 5.5.3 Task 3: Demonstrating frequentist confidence intervals as long-run probabilities of capturing a population parameter Goal: Simulate a population of size 1000, using \\(N(10, 2)\\), and take 100 independent, random samples of size 30 observations each from it. Calculate a Wald confidence interval (using an appropriate t-multiplier) for the population mean from each sample. Calculate what proportion of intervals contain the population mean and plot all these intervals, coloured by successful population mean capture or not. 5.5.3.1 Specific steps Set the seed to the last three digits of your student ID (this is your numeric student identifier number, NOT your UTORID). Set up the following objects with the appropriate simulation parameters, sample size and number of samples. sim_mean and sim_sd sample_size number_of_samples Calculate the appropriate t-multiplier (function: qt(...)) for constructing a 95% confidence interval in this context. Make sure your degrees of freedom are appropriate. Save it as tmult for later use. Create a vector called population, a simulated population using sim_mean and sim_sd and with 1000 values (function to generate random numbers from a normal distribution: rnorm(...)). Find the actual true mean for your population and save it as pop_param. This should be a numeric vector of length 1. Get 100 samples of size 30 from your population and save them in a vector called sample_set. (This might be a little tricky/unfamiliar, so here is one way to do it. You can just copy and paste this code.) sample_set &lt;- unlist(lapply(1:number_of_samples, function (x) sample(population, size = sample_size))) Create a new vector called group_id that will allow you to label the values from the 100 different samples above. Hint: rep(…) will be useful here, and has a great little argument called each. Take a look at the documentation (?rep) to compare the behaviour of times and each. Create a new tibble (a data type in R, like a dataframe), my_sim, that has two columns:group_id and sample_set. Create a new tibble, ci_vals, that starts with the dataset my_sim and then groups by group_id, and summarizes appropriately to create two new columns: mean and sd, that hold the means and standard deviations. There should be one row per group. Continue to change the tibble ci_vals by adding the following variables: lower and upper, two columns that hold the lower and upper bound of a 95% confidence interval for the group. You will need to calculate this. Consider the equations for a confidence interval and remember that we are using a t-multiplier that you have already calculated. capture which takes the values TRUE if the population parameter is in the 95% CI, and FALSE if not. These should be logical NOT character types. Create an object called proportion_capture that uses ci_vals and stores the proportion of intervals you created that capture the population parameter. This should be done using the object names, not ‘hard coded,’ so that if you changed your set.seed or your sample size, etc., and run all the code again, it would update this value. It should be a vector of length 1. Plot these 100 confidence intervals in one plot, with the means indicated as points, as well as and a dotted line for the population parameter. geom_errorbar() will be very helpful. Colour the confidence intervals by whether or not they contain the population parameter. If the interval include the population parameter, colour it #122451 if it DOES contain the parameter (TRUE) and #B80000 if it DOES NOT (FALSE). Set the figure caption to “Exploring our long-run ‘confidence’ in confidence intervals. This figure shows how often 95% confidence intervals from 100 simple random samples capture the population mean. The population was simulated from N(10, 2).” Set the caption to “Created by STUDENT NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022.” Replace STUDENT NAME with your name. Set the legend title to “CI captures population parameter.” Flip the coordinates using coord_flip() so the intervals are horizontal across your chart. Add the following sentence to your Markdown (not in a code chunk): \\(`\\)r proportion_capture*100\\(`\\) % of my intervals capture the the population parameter. Important! Use BACKTICKS around r proportion_capture*100. Things you put in backticks with an r at the beginning will be processed as inline R code. This key is located under the escape button on many keyboards.You may need to remove some spaces compared to the above. Briefly (~1 paragraph) describe why we can include the population parameter in this plot AND why we cannot usually compare the population parameter to our confidence interval in practice (e.g., when working with data that has not been simulated). Write this for a non-statistical audience. 5.5.3.2 Objects that must be carefully assigned to pass autograding sim_mean and sim_sd sample_size number_of_samples tmult population pop_param group_id sample_set my_sim , tibble with two columns ci_vals, tibble with 6 columns (after all steps completed) (See Errata for note) proportion_capture Figure 5.1: This is generally what your output should look like for the confidence interval task. Note: It won’t be exactly the same. 5.5.4 Task 4: Investigating whether there is an association between cGPA and STA303/1002 students correctly answering a question on global poverty rates In the ‘getting to know you’ survey at the beginning of STA303, students who participated in the survey were asked: What their current cumulative grade point average (CGPA) was at U of T. Whether the proportion of people living below the global poverty line had halved, doubled or stayed about the same in the last 20 years. So, what was the correct answer to the question about global poverty? The proportion of the global population living below the poverty line has HALVED! In the .xlsx file called sta303-mini-portfolio-poverty.xlsx there are 200 observations that represent the patterns in our class but from which is is not possible to identify individual students. The final goal of this task is to test whether there is a difference in cGPA between students who correctly answered this question and those who did not. 5.5.4.1 Goal Briefly describe the goal of this task to someone who has not read these instructions and only has a general awareness of hypothesis testing. Put it in your own words. 5.5.4.2 Wrangling the data Load the data, sta303-mini-portfolio-poverty.xlsx, into an object called cgpa_data, and apply the clean_names() function from the janitor package. Pay attention to the path to the file when providing it to R. It won’t know to look in the data folder if you don’t tell it. Rename the cGPA variable to cgpa and the poverty question answer to global_poverty_ans. Clean the data so only appropriate cGPA variables are included. Create a new variable called correct that takes the value TRUE (logical, not character) if the respondent answered ‘Halved’ and FALSE if they answered ‘Doubled’ or \"stayed about the same’. All of the above changes should be saved into the dataset called cgpa_data. I recommend using pipes %&gt;%. There is a keyboard shortcut too: Cmd+Shift+M (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+M (Windows). 5.5.4.3 Visualizing the data Create a set of histograms, in one figure, positioned on top of each other, that will allow you examine the data in a useful way. 5.5.4.4 Testing Choose an appropriate test to test whether there is an association between cGPA and if a student in STA303/1002 answered this question correctly. JUSTIFY your choice appropriately. Conduct the test AND the equivalent version using lm() interpret the result of the test appropriately in a sentence or two. Recall the types of tests you have now encountered, in this and previous courses: T-test t.test(x, data = my_data) or t.test(x~y, data = my_data) ANOVA `summary(aov(x~y, data = my_data)) Wilcoxon test wilcox.test(x, data = my_data) Mann-Whitney U wilcox.test(x~y, data = my_data) (note different use of wilcox function) Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test kruskal.test(x~y, data = my_data) Make sure you’re considering the assumptions for the tests as well as some of the other criteria about which tests we choose to reach for. You may need ask some questions in office hours or find relevant readings to help you consider the non-parametric tests. Your strategies here might be something to consider in your reflection. 5.6 Writing sample 5.6.0.1 Prompt Read the below job ad and write about the skills you would need to apply. Write on at least 2 soft skills and 2 analytic skills. The ad targets those with a MSc/PhD or those with 2+ years of experience, but imagine this requirement is not there. Soft skills.

This portfolio also aims to recap and refresh knowledge from your previous statistics courses as well as building your ability to create quality data visualizations. 6.1 General instructions Be very careful to follow instructions on variable naming. If you do not, your code won’t pass auto-grading and you will not receive the grades. This will not be eligible for regrading requests. Comment your code! In an R code chunk comments start with a # (pound sign or hashtag symbol). Don’t confuse this with the use of # to denote different levels of headings in the text parts (governed by Markdown syntax) of an R Markdown document. All figures and tables should have appropriate (and appropriately positioned) captions. You should neatly format your code. No strict style is required, but make sure it is easy to read your work. (Optional) You may find Google’s R Style Guide or the Tidyverse Style Guide interesting. Include your code in the body of the PDF itself (don’t set echo=FALSE, don’t hide/suppress etc.). Note that this is different to what you will be asked to do in the final project or in professional reporting. This is a demonstration of your skills. If asked to write and answer in words, write in full sentences. KNIT EARLY AND OFTEN! Don’t leave things till the last minute, your Rmd not knitting is not an emergency for which an extension will be granted. 6.1.1 Template You can access the template for this assessment here. There is currently a lot of ‘filler text’ and ‘filler code’ in the template that you will want to delete. Fun fact: All filler text sourced from Hipster Ipsum, which Katy Wang in the UG Stats office introduced me to. 6.2 Submission instructions Submit both your Rmd (must be called: sta303-w22-portfolio.Rmd) and PDF (must be called: sta303-w22-portfolio.pdf) on MarkUs. You do not need to submit any data or tex files. The PDF must be knit directly from the Rmd (not Word or HTML first). 6.3 Cover page You don’t have to use the provided template, but you DO need to write your portfolio in RMarkdown and include a standalone cover page. The cover page must have: A title and subtitle (you can use my examples in the template or update them as you see fit, no points for changing, but it might make it a better part of your own website or GitHUb portfolio, in the future) Your name Date (assessment submission date is fine) It should not have your table of contents or any analyses on it. In the template, you can change the colour of this cover to any colour you would like by replacing 6C3082 in the YAML (line 11) to another hex code. You could use this tool to help you: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/ 6.4 Introduction Write this section last or second to last (before the refection). In the introduction section, write a brief summary of the skills you have demonstrated in this portfolio, across the statistical skills sample, writing sample and reflection sections. Think of it like a cover letter for this document. It should be appropriate for a fairly general audience—imagine a future employer reading this. You may want to briefly explain the course context, as you understand it. What is STA303/1002 about? (Consider the learning objectives in the syllabus) Your introduction should be no longer than 300 words and must fit on one page. If you did the mini-portfolio, you may reuse your own phrasing from that introduction (e.g., in introducing the course context), but this is also an opportunity to improve upon it. 6.5 Statistical skills sample 6.5.1 A note on time management. Tasks 3 and 5 are essentially revision tasks for previous courses as I saw that there were still quite a few misunderstandings about these core concepts. If you find yourself unable to completely finish this portfolio, focusing your attention on the new material in Task 2 is a good strategy. I have tried to make the revision a useful practice opportunity for other skills. You’ll see that Task 3 asks you to build a function. You may not have seen this in other classes before, but use the templates provided to help you. I expect your focus to be on modifying these templates to display appropriate text, I don’t expect you to be an expert on error handling in R functions. 6.5.2 Task 1: Setting up libraries and seed value Set up a chunk called setup_portfolio where you load the tidyverse library. Set your chunk options to message=FALSE so all the package loading information isn’t included in your our output. You will need to make sure you run this chunk each time you start a new session so you can use many of the functions required. Create an object called last3digplus that takes the value 100 + the last three digits of your student ID number. Delete any placeholder library chunks in the template (if using). 6.5.3 Task 2a: Return to Statdew Valley: exploring sources of variance in a balanced experimental design (teaching and learning world) In a class interactive, we explored some tomato and honey data in a statistical farming simulator. Suppose you also have some data about strawberry yields (in kgs) across 18 different strawberry patches on your farm. There had been a problem with birds eating more than their fair share of your grandmother’s strawberries (there wouldn’t be enough for her famous jam!) so she had tried out three ‘treatment’ types: a scarecrow, covering the strawberries with netting and doing nothing (as a control). Each patch was harvested 6 times, twice under each treatment. Your grandmother says weather and soil conditions were remarkably consistent across the entire time. 6.5.3.1 Growing your (grandmother’s) strawberry patch # Don&#39;t edit this file # Sourcing it makes a function available # You CAN edit these comments # Load grow_my_strawberries() function source(&quot;grow_my_strawberries.R&quot;) Run the function grow_my_strawberries() (the chunk to source the function must be run first for this to work) with seed = last3digplus as the input, saving the output as the object my_patch. Alter the my_patch data so that treatment is a factor variable with the levels ordered as follows: “No netting,” “Netting,” “Scarecrow.” 6.5.3.2 Plotting the strawberry patch Create a plot, using ggplot2, where the x-xis has each plot (alphabetical) and the y-axis represents yield. Just for fun, make each point an upside-down triangle (strawberry-shaped). Within geom_point(), set pch = 25. Colour the points with the following colours: No netting (#78BC61), Netting (#E03400), Scarecrow (#520048). You will need to point both fill and color to the appropriate variable in your aesthetic mapping and use scale_fill_manual and scale_color_manual to set the colours. Apply theme_minimal() to the plot Add a caption “Created by YOUR NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022,” with your name included Add an appropriate figure caption Figure 6.1: Target figure for task 2a (your patch data will be different, though!) 6.5.3.3 Demonstrating calculation of sources of variance in a least-squares modelling context 6.5.3.3.1 Model formula Write out the model formulation for the model that fits a fixed effect for treatment, a random effect for patch, and a random effect for the interaction of treatment and patch. Make sure you also EXPLAIN each term. All random effects should have a statement of their distribution. While there are multiple ways to write out this model, I strongly suggest you mimic the structure written out for the honey model in the Stardew Valley interactive. Create a table with the following columns: Source of variation, the name for this source of variation Variance, the values you’ve calculated (var_patch, var_int, var_ab), Proportion, which is the proportion of variance in yield (not explained by treatment) explained by this source (round to 2 decimal places). Use kable to display the table nicely and add an a 6.5.3.3.2 Objects to create (proof-read carefully for autograding) 6.5.3.3.2.1 Tibbles my_patch, your ‘patch’ of strawberries, grown based on a set.seed that is the last THREE digits of your numeric student ID. agg_patch, starting with my_patch, group by patch and then summarize to create a new variable, yield_avg_patch. agg_int, starting with my_patch, group by both patch and treatment and then summarize to create a new variable, yield_avg_int that is the average strawberry yield for each patch and treatment combination. 6.5.3.3.2.2 Models int_mod, an interaction model including main effects. yield is the response and patch and treatment should be the predictors. patch_mod, a intercept only model using data aggregated to find the average yield per patch. agg_mod, 6.5.3.3.2.3 Numeric values Note: These should not be hardcoded (i.e., not var_patch = 3), the should make use of your models var_patch, variance in average yield patch-to-patch var_int, residual variance after fitting the version of this linear model with this most parameters var_ab, variance in yield explained by the interaction between patch and treatment, after accounting # Example tibble tibble(`Source of variation` = c(&quot;Source 1&quot;, &quot;Source 2&quot;, &quot;Source 4&quot;), Variance = c(&quot;var_b&quot;, &quot;var_ab&quot;, &quot;var_int&quot;), Proportion = c(round(0.3333333, 2), round(0.3333333, 2), round(0.3333333,2) )) %&gt;% # It is okay if that caption goes off the page when knitting knitr::kable(caption = &quot;An example table, where you can replace the appropriate values, including removing the quote marks around the variance values and calculating the proportions values&quot;) Table 6.1: An example table, where you can replace the appropriate values, including removing the quote marks around the variance values and calculating the proportions values Source of variation Variance Proportion Source 1 var_b 0.33 Source 2 var_ab 0.33 Source 4 var_int 0.33 6.5.4 Task 2b: Applying linear mixed models for the strawberry data (practical world) Fit 3 models (yield will be the response in all of them) mod0, a linear model with only treatment, mod1, a linear mixed model with treatment and patch (appropriate choices about what is a fixed vs random effect should be made) mod2, a linear mixed model with treatment, patch and the interaction of treatment and patch (appropriate choices about what is a fixed vs random effect should be made) Set up appropriate comparisons between these models, using a likelihood ratio test (lmtest::lrtest) Writing: make explicit comment on whether/where you are using REML / ML and WHY) 6.5.4.1 Justification and interpreation Chose which model, out of mod0, mod1 and mod2 is the most appropriate final model (make it clear which one you are choosing and justify why). Interpret the fixed effect coefficients. Discuss the proportion of variance, not explained by the fixed effects, that is explained by each source of variance in the model. Hint: If you have done both Task 2a correctly, it will match your variances from one of these model. This should be at MAX 1-2 paragraphs. 6.5.5 Task 3a: Building a confidence interval interpreter Write a function that helps you interpret a frequentist confidence interval with the appropriate language. Remember that we need to be careful about what our confidence level means and what value the interval is for. Note: For this and the next task, you are largely replacing and reworking what I have set up. I am definitely not claiming these are excellently specified functions, there are lots of other improvement we might try to make if we were really adding a useful function to a package. For now, I just want you to get a bit of a sense of where the errors and warnings you see when using other functions come from. The main focus should be on practising a sensible template for how to interpret these values. Honestly, this is not a place where you need to be creative in your writing. It will speed up your writing and communication if you have a mental script for each time you have to interpret a p value or confidence interval. 6.5.5.1 Specifications: The function should be called interpret_ci. It should take 4 arguments: lower, the lower bound of the confidence interval (numeric) upper, the upper bound of the confidence interval (numeric) ci_level, the confidence level this interval was calculated at, e.g. 99 or 95 (numeric) stat a description of the statistic of interest The output must be a full sentence that uses all 4 of the inputs to the function. It must be CLEAR what the confidence interval is making a claim about and the interpretation must be statistically appropriate. Warnings must be produced in the following cases: If lower or upper is not numeric. If ci_level is not an numeric value between 0 and 100. If stat isn’t a character string. You must run (and include) the following code after setting up your function: interpret_ci(10, 20, 99, \"mean number of shoes owned by students\") interpret_ci(10, 20, -1, \"mean number of shoes owned by students\") interpret_ci(10, 20, -1, tibble(stat = 3)) The results of the above must be printed out in the main text of the PDf (see examples in template) interpret_ci &lt;- function(lower, upper, ci_level, stat){ if(!is.character(stat)) { # produce a warning if the statement of the parameter isn&#39;t a character string # the spacing is a little weird looking so that it prints nicely in your pdf warning(&quot; Warning: stat should be a character string that describes the statistics of interest. The first part of this would be appropriate error text for this issue. You can reuse it as in in your code (not plagairisim concern), just make sure you delete this part.&quot;) } else if(!is.numeric(lower)) { # produce a warning if lower isn&#39;t numeric warning(&quot; Warning: NOPE! This error message should be improved.&quot;) } else if(!is.numeric(upper)) { # produce a warning if upper isn&#39;t numeric warning(&quot; Warning: NOPE! This error message should be improved.&quot;) } else if(!is.numeric(ci_level) | ci_level &lt; 0 | ci_level &gt; 100) { # produce a warning if ci_level isn&#39;t appropriate warning(&quot; Warning: Your ci_level is wrooooong. This error message should be improved.&quot;) } else{ # print interpretation # this is the main skill I want to see, writing a good CI interpretation. str_c(&quot;This is the confidence level: &quot;, ci_level, &quot;%. And the text fed to stat is &quot;, stat, &quot;. There is also the lower and upper bounds: &quot;, lower, &quot; and &quot;, upper, &quot;. This part needs to be fixed!&quot; ) } } # Test 1 ci_test1 &lt;- interpret_ci(10, 20, 99, &quot;mean number of shoes owned by students&quot;) # Test 2 ci_test2 &lt;- interpret_ci(10, 20, -1, &quot;mean number of shoes owned by students&quot;) # Test 3 ci_test3 &lt;- interpret_ci(10, 20, 95, 99) CI function test 1: This is the confidence level: 99%. And the text fed to stat is mean number of shoes owned by students. There is also the lower and upper bounds: 10 and 20. This part needs to be fixed! CI function test 2: Warning: Your ci_level is wrooooong. This error message should be improved. CI function test 3: Warning: stat should be a character string that describes the statistics of interest. The first part of this would be appropriate error text for this issue. You can reuse it as in in your code (not plagairisim concern), just make sure you delete this part. 6.5.6 Task 3b: Building a p value interpreter Write a function that will interpret p values based on strength of evidence. Use this table to help you. You can decide how to set up the ‘greater than’ vs ’strictly greater than’s, etc. just be consistent (and make sure you understand why I’m a little fuzzy about the borders anyways.) 6.5.6.1 Here is an EXAMPLE. This is not the answer. I DO NOT want to see this submitted as an answer. This would be an example of a p values interpreter that uses a 0.05 threshold to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. # This is just an example! MODIFY THIS CODE interpret_pval &lt;- function(pval, nullhyp){ if(!is.character(nullhyp)) { warning(&quot; Warning: Excuse me, why isn&#39;t nullyhyp a character string? This is not an appropriate error message, FYI. Make yours more professional.&quot;) } else if(!is.numeric(pval)) { warning(&quot;You p value should be a number.&quot;) } else if(pval &gt; 1) { warning(&quot; Warning: What do you mean, a p value greater than 1?!?! No way. This is also not an appropriately professional error message.&quot;) } else if(pval &lt; 0){ warning(&quot; Warning: Negative? I don&#39;t think so! This is also not an appropriately professional error message.&quot;) } else if(pval &gt; 0.05){ str_c(&quot;The p value is &quot;, round(pval, 5), &quot;, we fail to reject the hyothesis that &quot;, nullhyp) } else if(pval &lt;= 0.05){ str_c(&quot;The p value is &quot;, round(pval, 5), &quot;, we reject the hypothesis that &quot;, nullhyp, &quot;.&quot;) } } pval_test1 &lt;- interpret_pval(0.0000000003, &quot;the mean grade for statistics students is the same as for non-stats students&quot;) pval_test2 &lt;- interpret_pval(0.0499999, &quot;the mean grade for statistics students is the same as for non-stats students&quot;) pval_test3 &lt;- interpret_pval(0.050001, &quot;the mean grade for statistics students is the same as for non-stats students&quot;) pval_test4 &lt;- interpret_pval(&quot;0.05&quot;, 7) p value function test 1: The p value is 0, we reject the hypothesis that the mean grade for statistics students is the same as for non-stats students. __p value function test 2:__The p value is 0.05, we reject the hypothesis that the mean grade for statistics students is the same as for non-stats students. p value function test 3: The p value is 0.05, we fail to reject the hyothesis that the mean grade for statistics students is the same as for non-stats students p value function test 4: Warning: Excuse me, why isn’t nullyhyp a character string? This is not an appropriate error message, FYI. Make yours more professional. Specifications for your function: Your function must be called interpret_pval. It must take two arguments: pval and nullhyp. There must be an warning produced, with an appropriately informative (and professional!) error message, for values that p values cannot take AND non-character string null hypotheses. Use the template above and improve the text as well as adding new else ifs to the chain. The interpretation messages must be statistically appropriate and should not talk about rejecting or failing to reject the null. Instead the strength of evidence should be discussed appropriately. The output should be: a full sentence, that included the p value, rounded to 3 decimal places or replaced with “&lt;.001” if less than 0.001 (based on APA guidelines for reporting statistics), and incorporate the text of the null hypothesis. 6.5.7 Task 3c: User instructions and disclaimer Neither of these sections should be very long (1 to 3 paragraphs maximum). Please write in full sentences. 6.5.7.1 Instructions Write brief instructions for how to use your two interpreters to someone who is new to statistics, but has been told they need to apply some basic statistical methods in their summer research project. This should touch on what a null hypothesis is and what a population parameter is, and should give some examples and tips on wording a null hypothesis appropriately. It should also mention some common pitfalls in interpreting frequentist confidence intervals. 6.5.7.2 Disclaimer Write a disclaimer/warning for your p value interpreter, specifically. What should people know and be cautious of before using it? Note: This should not be “be careful, I might have messed up my code,” this should be based on what guidance someone should be aware of if they were going to use this interpreter to interpret the results of a independent samples t-test, for example. 6.5.8 Task 4: Creating a reproducible example (reprex) In Module 1, we discussed creating reproducible examples in R. Suppose you had written the below code. You want to summarize the dataset my_data into a new dataset called my_summary and find the mean value for each group, and just have one row per group, but for some reason it is not working. Note: DO NOT FIX THIS CODE. That is not the point of this activity. Goal: Create a reproducible example that would allow someone ELSE to understand the code and situation. In your submission there should be two things: A brief description IN YOUR OWN WORDS of what a reprex is and what you needed to consider to produce the reprex. The reprex output that would allow someone to completely reproduce your problem exactly. Think carefully about what you would need to provide. I.e., what you might post on a help-board as part of a request for help. You do NOT need to write up the rest of the description. Hint: The workflow will be something like (1) create the code chunk for the reprex, (2) copy the code chunk to clipboard (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C), (3) run reprex::reprex() in the console, (4) paste output into your template (it won’t be a runable code chunk, you should be able to just paste as is and not edit it at all). Delete the original chunk (i.e., there should be now code run in this section of your report when you knit it.) my_data &lt;- tibble(group = rep(1:10, each=10), value = c(16, 18, 19, 15, 15, 23, 16, 8, 18, 18, 16, 17, 17, 16, 37, 23, 22, 13, 8, 35, 20, 19, 21, 18, 18, 18, 17, 14, 18, 22, 15, 27, 20, 15, 12, 18, 15, 24, 18, 21, 28, 22, 15, 18, 21, 18, 24, 21, 12, 20, 15, 21, 33, 15, 15, 22, 23, 27, 20, 23, 14, 20, 21, 19, 20, 18, 16, 8, 7, 23, 24, 30, 19, 21, 25, 15, 22, 12, 18, 18, 24, 23, 32, 22, 11, 24, 11, 23, 22, 26, 5, 16, 23, 26, 20, 25, 34, 27, 22, 28)) my_summary &lt;- my_data %&gt;% summarize(group_by = group, mean_val = mean(value)) glimpse(my_summary) ## Rows: 100 ## Columns: 2 ## $ group_by &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3… ## $ mean_val &lt;dbl&gt; 19.67, 19.67, 19.67, 19.67, 19.67, 19.67, 19.67, 19.67, 19.67… 6.5.9 Task 5: Simulating p values 6.5.9.1 Setting up simulated data This revision task is meant to connect to Question 16 of your pre-knowledge quiz and help you visualize the behaviour of_p_ values. Set your seed to last3digplus (that you set up in Task 1) Create 4 simulated data sets (sim1 to sim4) of length 100000 and with two columns: group and val. Use tibble to create each dataset. For each dataset, set group = rep(1:1000, each = 100) For sim1 set val to be 100000 values drawn from \\(N(0, 1)\\) (see function rnorm()`). For sim2 set val to be 100000 values drawn from \\(N(0.2, 1)\\). For sim3 set val to be 100000 values drawn from \\(N(1, 1)\\). Stack all 4 datasets into one new dataset called all_sim, with an new column at the beginning called sim that takes the value 1 if the observation is from sim1, 2 from sim2, and so on. This is most of the code you will need bind_rows(sim1, sim2, sim3, .id = \"sim\") Make any alterations necessary to all_simso that you can join on the dataset sim_description to provided better labels for each simulation (but without including any irrelevant labels. You will need to include the code below to create this dataset. Plot histograms for the first three groups for each simulated dataset in one plot. Your final plot should use ggplot and facet_wrap. There should be four rows and three columns. The facets should be labelled with desc (the more informative description than just 1, 2, 3, 4). Provide an appropriate figure caption, set with your chunk options. Add a within-image caption: “Created by YOUR NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022,” with your name included Apply theme_minimal(). # Create sim_description # Dataset to merge with improved simulation names sim_description &lt;- tibble(sim = 1:4, desc = c(&quot;N(5, 1)&quot;, &quot;N(5.2, 1)&quot;, &quot;N(6, 1)&quot;, &quot;Pois(5)&quot;)) all_sim %&gt;% filter(group &lt;= 3) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = val)) + geom_histogram(bins = 40) + facet_wrap(desc~group, nrow = 3) + theme_minimal() + labs(caption = &quot;Created by YOUR NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022&quot;) Figure 6.2: Target first visualisation for task 5 6.5.9.2 Calculating p values Create a new dataset called pvals that starts with all_sim, groups by both desc AND group, and then summarizes to find the p value for each group, based on a one sample, 2-sided t.test, where the null hypothesis is the the population mean is 0. t.test(val, mu = 0)$p.value will pull out the p value as a value for you (when included within the appropriate code). .groups = \"drop\" may be useful to add to your summarize statement if you are getting a message about groups. Plot histograms of the p values, faceted by desc. I would recommend adding scales = \"free_y\" to your facet_wrap() call as well (not assessed: can you figure out what it does?) Use these statements appropriately in in your code to make the figure: geom_histogram(boundary = 0, binwidth = 0.05, fill = \"grey\", color = \"black\") xlim(0,1) Provide an appropriate figure caption, set with your chunk options. Add a within-image caption: “Created by YOUR NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022,” with your name included Apply theme_minimal(). Figure 6.3: Target second visualisation for task 5 6.5.9.3 Q-Q plots Create one final plot that creates a 2x2 figure with Q-Q plots for each simulation. You must determine what the distribution of a p value should be, WHEN THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS TRUE, and compare it it to the distributions of p values we have generated. I have provided a template for the code, you just need to decide which quantile function to put where the XXXXXXX is now. (e.g., qpois is the quantile function for the Poisson distribution). Also adjust the caption with your authorship and add an appropriate figure caption. pvals %&gt;% ggplot(aes(sample = pval)) + geom_qq(distribution = XXXXXXX) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) + facet_wrap(~desc) + theme_minimal() + labs(caption = &quot;Created by YOUR NAME in STA303/1002, Winter 2022&quot;) Figure 6.4: Target final visualisation for task 5 6.5.9.4 Conclusion and summary Remark briefly on: how what you have done in this task connects to the definition of a p value, and specifically how it connects to answering the below question from the pre-knowledge check. (Note: so that you didn’t have to wait to long for your PDF to knit, I made the number of simulations and simulation size a little smaller, but the idea is the same.) 6.6 Writing sample 6.6.1 Prompt Read Motulsky (2014), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4203998/pdf/210_2014_Article_1037.pdf, and paraphrase it with the goal of giving advice to your future self. I.e., YOU in the future is your audience, but keep the tone professional enough that you could share it as a LinkedIn post, or provide a copy to an acquaintance as advice. This shouldn’t be a summary of the full article. Instead, focus on what surprised you, what you didn’t know before, what you don’t want to forget. You can also disagree with the claims in the article if you see fit. As your task is to explicitly comment on this article, you must reference the article! The in-text APA style reference for this article is: (Motulsky, 2014) with the below the full reference to include at the end: Motulsky, H. J. (2014). Common misconceptions about data analysis and statistics. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology, 387(11), 1017–1023. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-014-1037-6 You might also incorporate it as “Motulsky (2014) states that…”. You don’t need the reference at the end of every sentence, but it should be clear to a reader what ideas have come from the article and what has come from you, throughout the piece. You can use another referencing style if you wish, or you can just copy this (that is not an academic offence!). Please be very mindful of proper paraphrasing! The main point of this activity is to put things in YOUR OWN WORDS. Read the provided advice in Module 2. There should not be too many direct quotes from the article, and better if there are none at all. IMPORTANT NOTE: A zero grade on paraphrasing will result in a zero on the ENTIRE writing component of your portfolio. Make sure your writing sample has an introduction and comes to a conclusion. Word count: 300–500 words (not including reference at the end). Please add a statement of your word count at the end of the passage. 6.7 Reflection Briefly, 100 to 200 words each, answer the following questions: What is something specific I’m proud of in this portfolio? How might I apply what I’ve learned and demonstrated in this portfolio in future work and study, after STA303/1002? What is something I’d do differently next time? 6.8 Rubric There is a breakdown of the overall contribution of each component to your grade below, followed by a more detailed rubric.

Past students have told me they hated doing the writing tasks, but then embarked on a summer internship and found the practice had been really helpful to them and allowed them to stand out as both data cruncher AND communicator. DO NOT LEAVE THIS TILL THE END! There will not be make up tasks offered if you get to the end of the semester and realize you’re missing a few percentage points. The knowledge basket activities listed in the (syllabus)(#syllabus) are guaranteed, and there will also be some additional opportunities offered (for example the punctuation art and Team Up! options also included in the examples below). 10.0.2 Examples All the student below would earn their full 5%, but in very different ways. 10.0.2.1 Student A Task Example grade/note Contribution to basket Module 1 Team Up! 8% score 0.4% Pre-knowledge check 60% score 0.5% Module 5 writing task Completed all phases 0.5% PD Proposal 70% score 0.7% PD Evidence &amp; reflection 70% score 2.1% Punctuation art 100% score 1% 10.0.2.2 Student B Task Example grade/note Contribution to basket Pre-knowledge check 88% score 1% PD Proposal 100% score 1% PD Evidence &amp; reflection 99% score 2.7% Punctuation art 100% 1% 10.0.2.3 Student C Task Example grade/note Contribution to basket Pre-knowledge check 67% score 0.5% Pre-knowledge check Workshop 0.5% Module 1 check-in Complete 0.1% Module 2 check-in Complete 0.1% Module 3 check-in Complete 0.1% Module 4 check-in Complete 0.1% Module 5 check-in Complete 0.1% Module 1 Team Up! 80% score 0.4% Module 2 Team Up! 70% score 0.35% Module 3 Team Up! 85% score 0.425% Module 4 Team Up! 50% score 0.25% Module 5 Team Up! 10% score 0.5% Module 1 writing task Completed all phases 0.5% Module 2 writing task Completed Create phase only 0.245% Module 3 writing task Completed all phases 0.5% Module 5 writing task Completed all phases 0.5% "],["knowledge-basket-writing-and-peer-feedback.html", "11 Knowledge basket: Writing and peer feedback 11.1 General instructions 11.2 Module 1 writing task 11.3 Module 2 writing task 11.4 Module 3 writing task", " 11 Knowledge basket: Writing and peer feedback 11.1 General instructions The module writing and peer feedback activities have three stages. Create phase due the first Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET Assess phase due the second Tuesday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET Reflect phase due the second Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET 11.1.1 Create phase The Create phase is due the first Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET Spend ~30 minutes writing a response to the prompt. Write about 200–500 words. The word count isn’t strict, but the submission requirements listed below ARE. The prompt should be clearly and comprehensively addressed. Your writing should be in full sentences and be broken into paragraphs as appropriate. Any grammatical or word choice errors should be minimal and not obstruct the meaning. There is a clear central idea that is well summarized in a concluding sentence(s). Submission requirements Your submission should be: typed (not handwritten) no more than one page single-spaced size 12 font margins should be no larger than 1 inch saved as a PDF 11.1.2 Assess phase The Assess phase is due the second Tuesday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET You will need to assess TWO of your peers in this phase. You will be asked: if they have met the submission requirements, to rate them on the rubric, to make a short comment about a strength of this piece of writing, to make a short comment about a way this piece of writing could be improved. 11.1.3 Reflect phase The Reflect phase is due second Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET Read the feedback received from your peers. Rate the usefulness on a 3-point scale. 11.1.4 General instructions These assessments can be used to make up your knowledge basket. They are also useful in helping you prepare for your portfolio writing samples and final project writing. Warning: MAKE SURE YOU CLICK SUBMIT! Check that each phase is showing as submitted. Students have occasionally struggled with this in peerScholar’s interface and no regrades/adjustments will be possible after the fact. Your mark for this assessment will be based on participation. There will be separate marks for each phase, i.e., you can get part marks overall. 45% for completing create, 45% for completing assess, 10% for completing reflect. Please note that participation not in the spirit of the assessment (e.g. just putting the Lorem Ipsum text, or giving feedback like “write better” and nothing else) will not get you marks. 11.2 Module 1 writing task Information Note Name Module 1 writing task Type (Main, Mini or Basket) Basket Value 0.5% (0.245%, 0.245%, 0.01%) Completion Due Create phase: Friday, January 14, 2022 at 3:03 p.m ET; Assess phase: Tuesday, January 18, 2022 at 3:03 p.m ET; Reflect phase: Friday, January 21, 2022 at 3:03 p.m ET; Submission instructions Submission: Via peerScholar Marked for completion Late submissions, accommodations, and extension policy No late submissions, accommodations, or extensions. 11.2.1 M1 Instructions Make sure you are familiar with the general instructions for these types of tasks. 11.2.1.1 M1 Prompt Discuss what you consider the most important dos and don’ts when giving peer feedback.

Discuss what you learn from the article, with a focus on what you notice about your own thinking when playing with the \"Hack Your Way To Scientific Glory\" interactive. Make sure you paraphrase appropriately (see Module 2 paraphrasing section) and add the reference for the article. (It is okay to put the reference by itself on a second page, if required.) Instead of reading from beginning to end try previewing and then skimming to be faster: Read the title. Pay attention to the “Filed Under” and date of publication. 🤔Why do you think we have assigned this reading to you? Skip the text until the interactive figure called “Hack Your Way To Scientific Glory.” When you change political party in section 1, or other items in section 2, how does the p-value change in section 4 of the interactive figure? 🤔What do you understand from this figure? What do you notice about your own thinking as you play with it? Tip: Reading one paragraph before and after a figure helps clarify the figure. Skip the text until the figure of the football field. 🤔 What do you understand from this figure? Skip the text until the figure called “Same Data, Different Conclusions.” 🤔 What do you understand from this figure? Read the two bolded quotes: “Science is great, but…” and “Human fallibilities….” Read the last paragraph (often the concluding paragraph). Now write your 200–500-word reflection on what you have learned. Paraphrase! That is, use your own words, don’t copy/paste. Use the paraphrasing how-to from the week 2 module to help you. Discuss what you noticed about your thinking while playing with the Hack Your Way To Scientific Glory\" interactive. Include a conclusion at the end. Use in-text citation as follows (Aschwanden, 2015) and put the reference at the end. Go back and read the entire text to see if your understanding was correct. 11.3.1.1.1 M2 Reference Aschwanden, C.

I strongly suggest that you use RMarkdown for your writing in preparation for your final project. Knit and submit as a PDF. (You won’t lose marks for doing it in Word, but if you’re not comfortable in RMarkdown yet, I’d really recommend working on that! Guide to writing LaTex equations in Word.) Write a short methods section that covers the final model from section 8.10. Add a reference to the version of R this analysis was conducted with AND a reference to the package used. Recommend including a statement like the following: “We fit a linear mixed model in R version 4.0.5 (R Core Team, 2021) using the lme4 package (Bates, Maechker, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015).” (For this writing, it is okay to copy this exactly or modify is slightly. You can find the version of R you are using by running version into your console. You can get the appropriate R citation running citation() and citation(\"lme4\") in your browser as well. Include the the model, written out in LaTeX. In the current reading it is written as a series of equations. You should rewrite it to be a single composite equation, like the way we have been writing them in class. Explain each model term below the model; paraphrase (do not just copy/paste) from the book. DO NOT plagiarize Roback and Legler (2021) or the original article (Sadler &amp; Christopehr, 2010). Use your own words. You will be writing something shorter, anyway. Write it as if you were one of the authors of the study (you can use ‘we’). Include all of the methods components you can from the list below (‘Methods components’). Section 8.2 will be especially helpful with this. You also can access the original research article through the U of T library, if you wish. Need help navigating library resources?

You may wish to use phrases from the Methods section of the Manchester Academic Phrase bank to help you describe your methods. The methods section is usually written in past tense and often in the passive voice (Swales &amp; Feak, 2012), though there is LOTS of discussion in academia about the use of passive vs active voice. We are not going to require you to write one way or the other for this—consistency is the key thing to aim for. Methods components Study design Setting Participants Data sources/ measurement Statistical methods Write the formula of the model Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses. Adapted from STROBE checklist (von Elm et al., 2007): https://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=available-checklists 11.4.1.1.1 Example from a different article: Modified from (Berlowitz et al., 2017): (1) We conducted a study to compare the effect of two strategies to control blood pressure on physical health: an experimental intensive treatment and the standard treatment currently in use. After recruitment, participants were randomly allocated (randomization) to either the intensive treatment or the standard treatment. (2) The study involved recruitment from 102 clinical sites from November 2010 to March 2013. (3) A total of 9,361 participants 50 years of age or older who had evidence of hypertension were included, but those with diabetes or prior stroke were excluded. (4) The source of the data is the SPRINT study. Physical health was measured using a questionnaire with scores ranging from 0 to 100, with greater scores meaning better physical health. Data were collected at baseline and follow up. (5a) To compare longitudinal change for physical health between the treatment groups, “we estimated a linear mixed model assuming linear mean change over time within each treatment group.” (5b) \"The model for 𝑌𝑖𝑗 (jthphysical health measurement for ith participant measured at time tij (in years)) is as follows: 𝑌𝑖𝑗= 𝛽0 +𝛽1𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽2𝑡𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽3𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑗+ 𝑏1𝑖 + 𝑏2𝑐𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗 (5c) Where 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑖 is the randomization assignment for the ith participant (1=Intensive-treatment; 0=Standard-treatment), 𝑐𝑖 denotes the clinic site for the ith participant (participants were randomized at 102 clinic sites), 𝑏1𝑖 is a subject-specific random effect, 𝑏2,𝑐𝑖 is a clinic-specific random effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑗 denotes the residual error component.\" “The models included participant-specific and clinic-specific random effects to address within-participant correlations as a result of repeated assessments and correlations among participants at the same [study] site. Fixed effects in the model included treatment group, follow-up time, and the interaction between the treatment group and follow-up time.” 11.4.1.1.2 Reference: Berlowitz, D. R., Foy, C. G., Kazis, L.

Or, more relevant to this course, if you do a data analysis and can’t share it with anyone in helpful ways, did youreally do anything? With this in mind, you will have the opportunity to choose an area of relevant professional development to pursue over the course of the semester. This could include technical skills that make you better at collaborating with others (version control, Git, GitHub), creating things others will find useful (an R package) or practising communication (oral or written). There is a 1% proposal due fairly early in the semester, and then the final submission of evidence of, and reflection on, your activity is worth 3% and due toward the end of the semster. Example professional development tasks include: Learning how to set up and use Git and GitHub (this might come in handy if collaborating on the final project with a group) Setting up a personal profile website (a bit like a digital CV, GitHub provides free hosting for simple sites) Participating in weekly TidyTuesday activities Writing a stats blog Developing an R package and sharing it on GitHub A public speaking based activity like a debating society or Toastmasters Conducting a series of interviews with industry professional or academics and publishing videos/write-ups Create a wildly successful stats memes TikTok à la Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti (okay, maybe not this one…but she’s well worth checking out) Note: the task must be related to communication or collaboration in some way. For example, ‘learning SQL’ would not be sufficiently directly related to communication or collaboration, but developing an R package and sharing it with others requires communication (writing the documentation) and is a great way to contribute to the collaborative and supportive R community. If you are not sure, please ask! You will use the SMART goals framework (see image below) when setting out your proposal. The more thought you put into this upfront, the easier collecting evidence and reflecting on your progress will be at the end.

Timeline is listed based on days/weeks or dates. No/unclear time for delays and troubleshooting is considered. Timeline is listed based on days/weeks or dates. Time for delays and troubleshooting is considered. 1 Structure There is no structure, very difficult to follow. Minimal evidence of an attempt to structure the proposal logically. Some structure but difficult to follow. The organization follows some logical structure. Well organized, follows a logical structure. 1 Writing mechanics No response OR response is largely unintelligible. Considerable writing and grammatical issues that completely obscure the meaning OR lots of slang and inappropriate word choice. Multiple sections are difficult to read but it is otherwise understandable. Slight difficulty in understanding one or two sections. Can read and follow along with minimal effort. Some grammatical or word choice errors are allowable, but they must not obstruct meaning. 2 Conclusion There is no concluding sentences. Minimal evidence of a concluding statement. The conclusion is weak not well supported. A conclusion is present but does not completely summarise the central idea. There is a clear central idea that is well summarised in a concluding sentences. 1 12.1.4 Checklist Before submitting your proposal, check the following: Your goal is specific. (Specific) At least one resource you will use to help you is identified. (Specific) It is clear how you will define success.(Measurable) It is clear how you will measure your progress. (Measurable) Your goal has an appropriate scope and is attainable. (Attainable) This is shown through a description of the steps you’ll need to take and what potential problems you might face. Related to timeline below. The goal is related to communication and/or collaboration appropriate for a statistician/data-related role. (Relevant) It is clear why this goal is relevant to you personally. (Relevant) The steps you want to complete can be completed in 7 weeks. (Attainable and Time-bounded) A timeline with dates/weeks for the required steps is included. (Time-bounded) The timeline shows some accommodation for troubleshooting/delays. (Time-bounded) There is a clear concluding sentence or sentences that wrap(s) up the proposal. You have proofread your proposal and made sure the structure is logical and there are not intrusive grammatical or word choice errors. You have written in full sentences. Your submission is typed (not handwritten), one page, single-spaced with size 12 font and the margins are no larger than 1 inch. Your final version is saved as a PDF. 12.1.5 Things to keep in minds as you start working towards your professional development goal Track your time A time sheet should be part of your evidence submission Create a work log document or file to store screenshots in, make notes of tasks you’ve completed This will make writing your reflection much easier 12.1.6 Example smart goal Note: This is not a collaboration/communication goal, but provides some examples of how to approach a SMART goal. Where there are ellipses (“…”) we are suggesting there would be more of the same, but this example should be enough to give you the idea. You should not use ellipses in this way in your own proposal. 12.1.6.1 Specific Goal: “Climb to the peak of Mount Robson over 2 weeks in January and write one blog post for my website about the journey.” Bad example: “Climb a mountain and write about it.” Which mountain? What type of writing and with what purpose? Resources: “I will need climbing equipment, my camera, notebook …” 12.1.6.2 Measurable Defining success: \"Reach the peak of Mount Robson and return and write at least 1 blog entry with a picture about the journey, all in 2 weeks.\" Bad example: “Climbed Mount Robson.” Needs more details about what this success looks like. Walk up a few metres and turn back? Relates to time-bounded also. Measuring my progress: “I will measure my progress by how many steps of my goals I have accomplished and the altitude of my climb relative to the elevation of Mount Robson (3,954 m). I will have taken a picture” 12.1.6.3 Attainable You have or can you learn the required skills: “I am sufficiently fit to make this climb safely and have climbed a similar mountain recently. I have a camera and am currently taking an online course on blogging.” Possible steps I need to take: Arrive at Mount Robson Visitors Center with my climbing plan. Climb until … on first day. … Write one blog entry with one picture. Bad example: “Make progress with my goal by 7% each day.” Not useful to you, what does 7% actually mean here? Will it really be the same amount of progress every day? Potential problems: Weather might be bad, and I may have to delay my climb by a few days. Bad example: “Something might not work.” What? In what way? Could you solve it? 12.1.6.4 Relevant Personal relevance: \"The climbing experience will help me learn new skills like … which will help me work towards becoming a professional climbing guide.\" Bad example: “Seems like fun.” 12.1.6.5 Time-bounded: “A 2-week journey from Jan 25th:Days 1-3to climb;Days4-6return;5 days for delays;3days to rest.” Source: Canadian Management Center, https://cmcoutperform.com/setting-smart-goals 12.2 Professional development evidence and reflection Information Note Name Professional development evidence &amp; reflection Type Main, Mini or Basket Basket Value 3% Due Thursday, March 31, 2022 at 3:03 p.m. ET Submission instructions Submission: PDF via Markus Late submissions, accommodations, and extension policy In the case of a personal illness/emergency, a declaration can be made, but must be submitted no more than 3 days after the due date.

[STA302 review] Explain the assumptions of linear regression and identify situations where they might be violated. Describe the execution and purpose of several common statistical tests (one-sample t-test, paired sample t-test, two-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA), and identify how to conduct them in a linear regression framework. Create a reproducible example (reprex) for use in explaining an error being produced by your code. 14.2 Instructor information Prof. Liza Bolton Course email: sta303@utoronto.ca Office hours: During the second half of Wednesday classes: 11:10—12:00 p.m. ET and 4:10—5:00 p.m. ET Please do not email my individual email with STA303 questions or use Quercus mail. It makes it harder to keep track of and address your questions. Sending me messages on three different platforms will NOT speed up my response. I will not respond messages that don’t follow the course communication policy. You can see the latest version of my email autoresponder here. 14.3 Upward management tips ‘Upward management’ is basically managing your manager.9 If you make their life easier and help them be more effective, this should also make your life easier and is a good investment in your own career and skills building. While our course isn’t a business, some of the basic parts of this concept apply well to your time at university AND can set you up for success in graduate studies and your future career. But why should you put effort into upward managing me? Well, while I will always seek to treat all students fairly and to listen to your feedback, YOU can make this easier or harder for me, and thus make this course better or worse for yourselves. For example, if I have to use all my time and energy following up on unclear emails for more information and dealing with students who haven’t followed instructions etc. etc….I won’t have that energy to put into writing TeamUp! activities to give you extra practice and opportunities to earn bonus points. 14.3.1 Communicate using the tools your manager prefers In business, this means knowing who likes face-to-face vs email, or whether your manager would rather receive an instant message than an email for a quick question. In STA303, this means: Using Piazza for all course admin and content questions. Using the appropriate forms for accommodations and regrade requests. Emailing sta303@utoronto.ca for private issues not otherwise covered by the other tools, e.g. emailing me your Accommodation Services letter, requesting an extension to an assessment that conflicts with essential travel. Asking questions in office hours. 14.3.2 Write good emails (when emails are appropriate) In business, this might mean: Choosing who should be the main recipients vs CCed/BCCed. Ensuring your contact details are clear in your signature. Make sure the subject line is informative and short Making the text of the email as clear and concise as possible. Use proper grammar and punctuation. Don’t use emoji in formal emails. If in doubt, leave ’em out. In STA303, this looks like: Everything in the right-hand column, plus the following. Starting an email with “Hi Prof. Bolton,” or “Hi Liza,”10 Sign off the email with your preferred name (i.e. what should I call you when I reply) and if your have different official name, include that and your UTORid below your name. Subject line including [Prof. Bolton] or [TA name] if your email is for a specific person. 14.3.3 Understand your manager’s goals In business, this might look like understanding their KPIs and how you can help make sure these are met. In STA303, most of my goals are for you, like that you learn useful statistical skills, improve your writing skills etc. I also personally want to improve as an instructor and have fun talking about something I love. You can help me with these goals by working on this course every week, trying your best, asking for help early and often, engaging with feedback gathering mechanisms and providing constructive feedback if something is not working. 14.3.4 Demonstrate self-management and resilience while also asking for help and flagging problems early. In business, this might look like: Being proactive about addressing possible problems before they occur. Managers like a ‘no surprises’ policy. Preparing a list of questions to cover in a meeting or to compile in an organized fashion into one email (instead of ten). Searching for answers yourself before asking your manager and improving your strategies for finding available information. In STA303, this looks like: Putting in a little effort into find answers before posting on Piazza/asking in class. (Have you searched Piazza? have you re-read/watched the assigned materials? have your checked the syllabus and recent announcements?) Come to office hours often, lists of questions very welcome! Getting in touch (or asking your registrar to) early if you might hate to miss a lot of class. It is usually easier to find a solution if I know things ahead of time, or as soon as possible after. 14.4 Recap of linear models 14.4.1 Why model? The goal of a model is to provide a (relatively) simple summary of a dataset. We can describe data AND make predictions. 14.4.2 Linear models In a linear model, \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1i} + ... + \\beta_px_{pi} + \\epsilon_i\\) The response is predicted by a linear function of explanatory (or predictor) variables plus an error term. a.k.a. DATA = MODEL + ERROR 14.4.3 Linear regression assumptions L: your model is Linear. I: Errors are Independent (usually satisfied if observations are independent). N: Errors are Normally distributed with expected value zero, \\(E[\\epsilon_i]=0\\) E: Equal/constant variance (homoscedasticity), \\(\\text{var}[\\epsilon_i] = \\sigma^2\\). We can express “I N E” above as assuming the errors are i.i.d Normal with mean of zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), \\[\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\] 14.4.4 What makes it a linear model? A model is linear if it is linear in the parameters. That is, all the \\(\\beta\\) enter the model in a linear way. It is totally fine if the predictor variables enter the model in a non-linear way. 14.4.4.1 Linear \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\beta_2x_i^2 + \\epsilon_i\\) \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + γ_1δ_1x_{1i} + \\beta_2\\exp(x_{2i}) + \\epsilon_i\\) 14.4.4.2 NOT linear \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i^{\\beta_2} + \\epsilon_i\\) \\(y_i = \\beta_0 exp(\\beta_1x_{1i}) + \\epsilon_i\\) Internally screaming “DON’T LET THE BETAS TOUCH” often helps me remember what is not linear. Additionally, don’t let them do anything weird, like get exponentiated. 14.4.5 Optional refresher reading 14.4.5.1 Brief discussion of assumptions with examples Section 1.3 of Broaden your Statistical Horizons on the assumptions of OLS https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-bysh/ch-MLRreview.html#ordinary-least-squares-ols-assumptions [freely accessible] 14.4.5.2 Fitting linear models in R Section 1.6 of Broaden your Statistical Horizons on Multiple linear regression (bootstrapping not assessed) https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-bysh/ch-MLRreview.html#multreg [freely accessible] 14.4.5.3 Delicious mathematics Chapter 1 of Wood, S.

One of the most common issues students encounter when learning R is that they are trying to use functions that they haven’t installed or loaded the package for. Make sure you’ve read the slides about RStudio on the JupyerHub because packages you install there will need to be reinstalled each session if they are not the list of automatically available ones. tidyverse is automatically available so you only need to run library(tidyverse) or use the namespace for the function tibble::glimpse(). 14.5.2 The variables I hope most of the variables here are clear from their names. In particular, we will be interested in species, which has three levels (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap), sex (male, female, NA), body_mass_g (body mass in grams) and flipper_length_mm (length of their flippers measure in mm). We’re not using the variables about the bills, but I thought this diagram was interesting anyway. Artwork by @allison_horst ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Here are all our variables of interest in one plot. Note: In this chart and in future analyses involving sex, penguins with an unknown sex have been removed. 14.6 Common statistical tests as linear regression There is an interactive version of the below notes at this link. 14.6.1 Introduction You have probably encountered several statistical tests in your studies so far. 14.6.1.1 Parametric E.g. one-sample t-tests, paired t-tests, two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA Parametric tests make assumptions about the distribution of the population from which our sample data have been drawn. 14.6.1.2 Non-parametric E.g. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallace Non-parametric tests do not assume that our outcome is Normally distributed. They are sometimes called ‘distribution-free,’ but note that this is because they have fewer assumptions than parametric tests, not because they have no assumptions at all. 14.6.1.3 Aside: But why are there two types of tests? Parametric tests are more powerful, i.e., they have a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one there to find. So why would you ever use a less powerful test? Well, with great power comes great responsibility more assumptions that must be valid to proceed. Non-parametric tests are a great choice when your outcome is an ordinal variable, is ranks, or there are problematic outliers. For the purposes of this lesson, we’re going to focus more on parametric tests, but also take a look at the corresponding non-parametric tests with the slight white lie that they are just ranked versions of their parametric companions. This approach is pretty good as long as you have a reasonable sample size. Imagine this: You’re on a ship trying to spot land. Parametric tests are the crew member with the best eyesight, but they can be fussy and the conditions have to be right for them to work in or they will breakdown. Non-parametric tests are the crew member with not quite as good eyesight, but they’re more laid back about the conditions you make them work in. In the following sections we’ll explore several of these tests. 14.6.2 One-sample t-test I am assuming you’ve seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below. 14.6.2.1 Use case You want to know if it is believable that the population mean is a certain value (our ‘hypothesized value’ below). 14.6.2.2 Assumptions The data are continuous. The data are normally distributed. The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample (Do these sound familiar from linear regression?) 14.6.2.3 Hypotheses \\[H_0: \\mu = \\text{hypothesized val}\\] \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne \\text{hypothesized val}\\] What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population mean is some hypothesized value. The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows: \\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\text{hypothesized val}}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\] We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom df = n - 1 and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme. 14.6.2.4 Example Suppose existing research suggests that the average weight of penguins is 4000 grams. You want to see if this makes sense for your new penguins data. \\[H_0: \\mu = 4000\\] \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne 4000\\] The penguins dataset is already loaded, you you don’t have to run any libraries. Use the t.test() function run a one-sample t-test. t.test(penguins$body_mass_g, mu = 4000, var.equal = TRUE) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: penguins$body_mass_g ## t = 4.6525, df = 341, p-value = 4.7e-06 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 4000 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 4116.458 4287.050 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 4201.754 14.6.2.5 Now as a linear model First, consider the following, what would a linear regression with no predictor variables and just an intercept tell you? Create a linear regression model called mod1(replace the blank below) that is an ‘intercept only model’ with body_mass_g as the response. mod1 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ 1, data=penguins) summary(mod1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ 1, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1501.8 -651.8 -151.8 548.2 2098.2 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 4201.75 43.36 96.89 &lt;2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom ## (2 observations deleted due to missingness) It turns out the estimate from this linear regression is the same as the sample mean. mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE) #na.rm = TRUE removes missing values ## [1] 4201.754 Now, recall that with the t-test, we calculate our test statistic by subtracting the hypothesized value from the mean. Let’s run the linear model again, but on the left-hand side of the formula, subtract the hypothesized value. mod2 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g-4000 ~ 1, data=penguins) summary(mod2) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g - 4000 ~ 1, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1501.8 -651.8 -151.8 548.2 2098.2 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 201.75 43.36 4.652 4.7e-06 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 802 on 341 degrees of freedom ## (2 observations deleted due to missingness) Compare the results of this summary(mod2) and your earlier t-test. You should see that the t value, degrees of freedom and p-value are the same for both analyses. Thus, our one sample t-test hypotheses, \\[H_0: \\mu = \\text{hypothesized val}\\] \\[H_1: \\mu \\ne \\text{hypothesized val}\\] are equivalent to our linear regression hypotheses about the intercept, \\[H_0: \\beta_0 = \\text{hypothesized val}\\] \\[H_1: \\beta_0 \\ne \\text{hypothesized val}.\\] 14.6.2.6 Wilcoxon signed-rank test While the linear regression approach to the one-sample t-test is exact, we can also approximate the Wilcoxon rank-sign test with linear regression. See below. Note: The above is just example from some toy data, but aims to illustrate how a t-test is treating the data and how the Wilcoxon test is treating the data. # Function to get signed rank of each observation signed_rank = function(x) sign(x) * rank(abs(x)) # The wilcoxon test function wilcox.test(penguins$body_mass_g, mu = 4000) ## ## Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction ## ## data: penguins$body_mass_g ## V = 34723, p-value = 0.0004829 ## alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 4000 # Equivalent linear model mod3 &lt;- lm(signed_rank(penguins$body_mass_g-4000) ~ 1) summary(mod3) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = signed_rank(penguins$body_mass_g - 4000) ~ 1) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -334.63 -173.13 -22.13 187.87 305.37 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Likewise for the Wilcoxon. The R code (not evaluated here) would be as follows: # Built-in Wilcoxon matched pairs wilcox.test(x1, x2, paired = TRUE) # Equivalent linear model: summary(lm(signed_rank(x1 - x2) ~ 1)) 14.6.3 Dummy variables Let’s take a quick detour before we explore the next tests. We’ll need to understand the concept of dummy variables and contrasts first. 14.6.3.1 The matrices we use for linear regression Recall that we can express our linear regression in matrix form: \\[\\mathbf{y} = X\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon\\] where \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\\\ y_2 \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ y_n \\end{pmatrix} , \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol\\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\\\ \\beta_2 \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ \\beta_p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\\\ \\varepsilon_2 \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ \\varepsilon_n \\end{pmatrix} \\] and \\[X = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; x_{11} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1p} \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{21} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2p} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{n1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{np} \\end{pmatrix}\\] We often talk about X as the model matrix (or design or regressor matrix) and it will be the focus of this section. 14.6.3.2 Getting our model matrix in R Let’s start by fitting a model with body_mass_g as the response and flipper_length_mm and species as the predictor variables. (Note: Users of statistics use a lot of different words to refer to the same thing. Can you think of other terms people might use instead of response and predictor?) mod4 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species, data=penguins) summary(mod4) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -927.70 -254.82 -23.92 241.16 1191.68 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

I’ve applied head() to stop the entire thing being printed. head(model.matrix(mod4), n = 20) ## (Intercept) flipper_length_mm speciesChinstrap speciesGentoo ## 1 1 181 0 0 ## 2 1 186 0 0 ## 3 1 195 0 0 ## 5 1 193 0 0 ## 6 1 190 0 0 ## 7 1 181 0 0 ## 8 1 195 0 0 ## 9 1 193 0 0 ## 10 1 190 0 0 ## 11 1 186 0 0 ## 12 1 180 0 0 ## 13 1 182 0 0 ## 14 1 191 0 0 ## 15 1 198 0 0 ## 16 1 185 0 0 ## 17 1 195 0 0 ## 18 1 197 0 0 ## 19 1 184 0 0 ## 20 1 194 0 0 ## 21 1 174 0 0 You’ll notice that even though we only had an intercept and two variables, we have four columns in our model matrix. You should also notice that R has given the columns helpful names, and that we have a column for the Chinstrap species and the Gentoo species, but not the Adelie species. Further, recall that when we are working with a categorical variables we call the different values the the variables can take “levels”. I may also refer to these as factor variables, and talk about the “levels of the factor.” What R is doing is dropping the first level (alphabetically) of the categorical variable and then creating dummy variables for each of the other levels. The dropped level becomes our reference level and this should be familiar from interpreting summary output in previous courses where you have conducted multiple linear regressions with categorical variables. A dummy variable is also called an indicator variable, and it indicates whether or not the given observation takes that level or not. I.e., if the 40th penguin in this dataset had a 1 in the speciesGentoo column, then I know it is a Gentoo penguin, and that it won’t have a 1 in the speciesChinstrap column because each penguin can only have one species. More generally, the sum across the row of the dummy variables for one categorical variable will either be 0 (if that observation has the reference level) or 1 (not the reference level) but you will never have more than one ‘one’ amongst the dummies for a given categorical variable. 14.6.3.2.0.1 [Unassessed aside] Why do we have to drop one of the levels? You may recall that for the matrix calculations required to get our vector of \\(\\beta\\)s, we need to be able to invert X our matrix. We can only invert matrices for which all the columns are linearly independent and if we have the intercept AND dummies for all the levels of the categorical variable, our matrix will be linearly dependent. Additional optional discussion here. 14.6.4 Two means Back to tests! Independent t-tests let you compare two means. I am assuming you’ve seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below. 14.6.4.1 Use case You want to know if it is believable that two independent groups have the same population mean. 14.6.4.2 Assumptions The data are continuous. The data are normally distributed (in each group). Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample The variances for the groups are equal. Notice that these are the same assumptions as the one-sample t-test, but with the equality of variances assumption added. 14.6.4.3 Hypotheses \\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\] \\[H_1: \\mu_1 \\ne \\mu_2\\] What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population means for both groups are the same. This differs from the one sample test because we have uncertainty about BOTH values here. Both are population parameters that we don’t know. The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows: \\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x_1} - \\bar{x_2}}{\\sqrt{s^2(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}} \\] We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom \\(df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\\) and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme. 14.6.4.4 Example Conduct an independent t-test to test if the mean of body_mass_g is the same for male and female penguins (sex). Add your code below. Note: you must set , var.equal = TRUE as one of the arguments for it two be the independent t-test. If you don’t set this we are conducting a Welch’s t-test. I won’t be covering this, but it is covered in the source credited at the end of this activity. t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins, var.equal = TRUE) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: body_mass_g by sex ## t = -8.5417, df = 331, p-value = 4.897e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -840.8014 -526.0222 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group female mean in group male ## 3862.273 4545.685 Now, based on what we’ve learned, write a linear model using the lm() function to do the same this as our independent t-test. Save the model as mod5. mod5 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins) summary(mod5) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1295.7 -595.7 -237.3 737.7 1754.3 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

There is a difference here in that the sign of the test statistics differs. That does not matter as out t-distribution is symmetrical and we’re doing a two-tailed test. 14.6.4.5 Mann-Whitney U Similar idea to before, except for this test it is just rank not signed rank. # Wilcoxon / Mann-Whitney U (multiple names) wilcox.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins) ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction ## ## data: body_mass_g by sex ## W = 6874.5, p-value = 1.813e-15 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 # As linear model with our dummy-coded group_y2: summary(lm(rank(body_mass_g) ~ sex, data = penguins)) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = rank(body_mass_g) ~ sex, data = penguins) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -183.68 -74.13 -16.63 91.32 162.87 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Let’s look specifically at one-way ANOVA (or the F-test). It tests if all the means for several groups (more than 2) are the same or if at least one is different. I hope this sounds a bit like the next evolution from the independent t-test… (+ 1000 stats respect points to anyone who draws Pokemon-esque evolutions of these three tests…with regression as the mega-evolution…) 14.6.5.2 Assumptions And it just so happens that the assumptions for the one-way ANOVA (also called the F-test) are EXACTLY the same as for the independent t-test. The data are continuous. The data are normally distributed (in each group). Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample The variances for the groups are equal. 14.6.5.3 Hypotheses \\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = ... = \\mu_k \\] \\[H_1: \\text{at least one }\\mu \\text{ differs from the others} \\] 14.6.5.4 Example Let’s now look at body mass across species. Suppose we wanted to know if was believable that the the means body mass in grams was the same across all three species. This is when we could fit a quick ANOVA to test this. The aov() allows us to do this. summary(aov(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins)) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## species 2 146864214 73432107 343.6 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Residuals 339 72443483 213698 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## 2 observations deleted due to missingness That looks a lot like the output from calling summary on lm()…in fact, aov is just a wrapper for lm! Which means it has been linear regression the whole time. 14.6.6 Credits Credit to Jonas Kristoffer Lindeløv for the excellent resource this resource is based on. There are more examples there than we will cover in this course. 14.7 Reproducible examples (reprex) 14.7.1 What is a reproducible example? Well, it is an example that someone else can reproduce… Specifically, it is a minimal example needed for someone helping you to reproduce an error or other behaviour you would like to show them with. This is especially helpful while we are all working online! I can’t look over your shoulder in a lab to see what’s wrong. 14.7.2 Why should you care about creating reproducible examples? Useful professional skill for those working with R and other programming languages in graduate school/future employment (concepts transferable to programming in any language). The best way to help me (and the TAs and your classmates) help YOU on Piazza. The process of preparing a reprex to ask for help forces you to think about your code in a specific way that can help you spot the problem without actually having to ask anyone else (this literally happened to me about 2 hours before writing this slide!) 14.7.2.1 Other things to know Please try to use use reprexes when asking for help on Piazza! The outputs from the reprex package work beautifully on Piazza, too. No more upside down photos of computer screens taken from phones, please! reprex is installed in the JupyterHub and will be loaded whenever we run library(tidyverse) You won’t have to worry about the data side of reprexes as much for this course, as in almost all cases we will all be working with the same data. But! It is a key skill if you will be working with data and programming languages in the future. 14.7.3 Watch the creator of the reprex package explain it Jenny Bryan is a hero of mine, and this was even BEFORE I knew she was the creator of the reprex package. I think the whole video is excellent, and you’re very welcome to watch all of it, but at minimum, please watch the following time intervals: 0:00 - 7:20 (background and initial demo) 14:08 - 29:48 (philosophy and examples) The video and slides are on this page: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/learn-reprex.html 14.7.4 Using reprexes on Piazza Watch this 4 minute video. Web version embedding for MyMedia is not great, I would recommending opening the link and/or going full screen. 14.8 Reading strategy: previewing and skimming In graduate school and/or in future employment, it is likely that you will need gather and synthesize information from a range of written sources. To decide if a source is useful to you, and to be as efficient and effective as possible, it is important to have strategies for approaching reading. In the next module, for the knowledge basket writing task, you will be guided through reading an article called Science isn’t broken and asked to respond to it. You can also keep this in mind as a stategry for ‘first reads’ of course notes, or when re-reading to find some. Previewing a written text helps you think about the origins and purpose of the text, how it is organised, and where you expect to find information. Skimming is done after previewing, and is a strategy of reading key paragraphs, like the first and last which usually introduce and conclude the piece, as well as reading the opening sentences of in-between paragraphs and paying attention to figures, captions and any other emphasized text. 14.9 Getting ahead on Module 2 Students who are unfamiliar with the tidyverse, especially dplyr and ggplot2, may find Module 2 to be quite full on. You may wish to start the readings for the next module early in this case. Wickham &amp; Grolemund.

With respect to the ethical professional practice components, think of this as just a very high-level survey of these ideas; we aren’t going very deep on any of them, but some will set up conversations/tasks later in the course. We’ll revisit some of these concepts in later classes, like case-control studies and logistic regression, black box algorithms (very briefly) when we discuss GAMs and issues of confounding, proxies and ethical sourcing of data, throughout. We’ll touch on web scraping in the Team Up! activity for this module. Folks who have taken or TAed STA130 might be more familiar with some of these concepts than others, but I’m not assuming much prior knowledge. 15.3 Readings for this module There are several required readings in this module. Keep in mind the previewing and skimming strategies discussed in Module 1. 15.3.1 R for Data Science (+ story time) Wickham &amp; Grolemund. R for Data Science. 2017 Chapter 3: Data Visualization and Chapter 5: Data transformation Hadley Wickham is a bit of rockstar 👨🎤 in the R world.11 If you took part in the Independent Summer Statistics Community (ISSC), you’re probably already well aware of my love for his and Garrett’s excellent book, R for Data Science. When I brought on a new consultant for my business in New Zealand, he was transitioning from organic chemistry and wanted to become a better data analyst. He worked through this book and in just a few months was leading the analysis for client engagements. It is also the first resource to which I point students who are interested in extra materials for data science. In the case study section of this module, I’ll walk you through a case study using a range of the functions introduced in these chapters and some personal favourites. After these readings and the case study, you should be ready to start your portfolio assessments. 15.3.2 Common misconceptions about data analysis and statistics Motulsky, H.J., 2014. Common misconceptions about data analysis and statistics. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-014-1037-6 For the portfolio assessment, you will be asked to write some advice to future you, based on the article Common misconceptions about data analysis and statistics by Harvey J. Motulsky. Focus on what surprised you, what you didn’t know before, what you don’t want to forget. You can disagree with the article’s claims, too. Direct link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4203998/pdf/210_2014_Article_1037.pdf 15.3.3 To predict and serve? Lum, K &amp; Isaac, W. To predict and serve? (2016). https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x#sign960-bib-0001 This article is an excellent and accessible introduction to ideas around predictive policing and the current issues. Consider it with the other comments under the Analyzing data section. (Lum’s other work, previously as the Lead Statistician at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group and now at Twitter is awesome!) (If you’ve seen Minority Report, maybe you were already skeptical about predicting crimes before they happen…but probably for different reasons.) 15.3.4 Science isn’t broken Aschwanden, C. (2015). Science Isn’t Broken: It’s just a hell of a lot harder than we give it credit for. Retrieved from https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken This reading will also be used in the Module 2 writing task. Please read the instructions there before approaching this reading, as it talks you through a practical example of (previewing and skimming)[#previewskim]. 15.4 Data wrangling and visualization 15.4.1 Tidy data 15.4.1.1 A bit of advice…and why we need tidy data If I had one thing to tell biologists learning bioinformatics, it would be “write code for humans, write data for computers”\"\".Vince Buffalo ((vsbuffalo?)(https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/358699162679787521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)), July 20, 2013 This advice applies to everyone learning how to work with data. The dplyr functions we are learning help us “write code for humans”, but how do we “write data for computers”? “It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data” Hadley Wickham, creator of the tidyverse and developer of dplyr Artwork by @allison_horst 15.4.1.2 Rules of tidy data There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy: Each variable must have its own column. Each observation must have its own row. Each value must have its own cell. Image from: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html 15.4.1.3 Recognizing Tidy Data “For a given dataset, it is usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.” (Wickham, 2014) A general rule of thumb: It is easier to describe functional relationships between variables (e.g., z is a linear combination of x and y, density is the ratio of weight to volume) than between rows. It is easier to make comparisons between groups of observations (e.g., average of group A vs. average of group B) than between groups of columns. (Wickham, 2014) 15.4.1.4 Further reading on tidy data (optional) While I know many of you will have covered tidy data in STA130, I know others will not be familiar with it. You will need to be able to think about whether or not your data is tidy for several assessments in this course. Wickham &amp; Grolemund. R for Data Science. 2017 Chapter 12: Tidy data 15.4.2 Student grades case study There are (at least) two ways you could approach this case study: Try it yourself first with the file that has “_guided” in the name and then watch the video. Follow along with the video. I’ll be using the file with “_minimal” in the name. I’ve tried to design it so either way will work, but I think following along with the video might be the best use of your time, if it works for your learning style. Case study on the Jupyter Hub If you would rather work locally, there is information on how to download files from the JupyterHub in the Resources section of the course guide. Note: You’ll have to navigate to the Home directory in the Files pane to find this activity in STA303-w22-activities/m2-casestudy. See the instructions using RStudio with the JupyterHub. 15.4.2.1 Videos Please note, I filmed these videos last year, so please ignore any assessment/admin comments. The actual R work is all still totally relevant. Video 1: Set up Video 2: Data wrangling Video 3: Data viz 15.5 Ethical professional practice for statisticians The following sections consider the whys and whats of ethical practice organized under the categories of: getting data: confounding and study designs, human research ethics, web scraping and APIs, Indigenous data sovereignty); analyzing data: HARKing &amp; multiple testing; making decisions with data: algorithmic bias and transparency. There is a lot of ground covered, though lightly, and it may feel intimidating or overwhelming—there is so much to consider, so much we could get wrong! So, here is some advice from our TA Sonia Markes, who was part of crating this module: developing the judgment and skills related to these topics takes time and no analysis is ever perfect—we rely on collaboration with other scientists and statisticians who all try to think critically to avoid harm and to improve our collective knowledge and understanding. 15.5.1 Why should statisticians be ethical? I hope this questions seems a bit silly to most of you, shouldn’t we all strive to be ethical in our professional and personal lives? Well regardless of your personal philosophy, there are additional considerations with respect to our professional ethics. Professional societies: You may have heard of the Hippocratic oath (“first do no harm”) in Medicine and there are similar codes of conduct for Statisticians (see the links to the Canadian and US version below) through our own professional societies. Research ethics boards: If you are conducting research within universities, it will often have to be approved by a research ethics board. You need to have the skills and knowledge to help appropriately design studies that can be approved under these rules. Legal and business considerations: Unethical behaviour can also get you are your future employers into trouble. There are of course reputational risks, but there can also be legal risks for creating algorithms that discriminate against protected attributes like gender or ethnicity. Statistical tools are used to create knowledge. Therefore, anyone using statistical tools is responsible for the knowledge they create through their data collection and analyses. As ethical statisticians it is important to: + be accurate in our analyses and conclusions + be alert to possible consequences of our results/recommendations on others + be honest in reporting results, even when we don’t get the results we hoped for + be respectful of other reasonable results (based on well-conducted research) even if they differ from our own + be mindful of what your data represents, especially if it represents people or their behaviour (a study on people has subjects, not objects) + share credit when our work is based on the ideas of others + and more… You will be asked to write your own code of ethics in your final project. 15.5.1.1 Relevant codes of conduct for statistical societies/associations in North America Statistical Society of Canada: https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf American Statistical Association: https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx 15.5.2 Getting data 15.5.2.1 Confounding and study design 15.5.2.1.1 Confounders (i.e. confounding factors or confounding variables) In an observational study, variables are “observed” (measured and recorded) without manipulation of variables or conditions by the researcher. Two variables are confounded if their effects on the response variable are mixed together and there is no way to separate them out. If this is the case, we have no way of determining which variable is causing changes to the response. Example: As ice creams sales rise, so do drownings. But are people drowning because of ice cream? What would be a plausible confounder for this relationship? (Hint: ☀️🌡️️) There is no ‘test’ for confounding. But this is a great thing if you don’t want the robots to take your job anytime soon. We need smart people who can think well about confounding. When we have data from an observational study, we can often only conclude association between variables, not causation. It is worth noting that methods of causal inference are significant area of research for statisticians and others. So, do we give up on claiming causation? No! 15.5.2.1.2 Designing studies to avoid confounding In an experiment (or randomized trial or randomized control trial) variables and/or conditions are manipulated by the researcher and the impact on other variable(s) is measured and recorded. The key is to randomly assign some individuals to one treatment (or condition) and randomly assign others to another treatment (sometimes this other treatment is a control) Note: you can have more than two treatments groups too—what is important is that individuals are randomly assigned to them! The groups (before treatments are applied) should be very similar to each other with respect to the other variables. Any differences between individuals in the treatment and control groups would just be due to random chance! If there is a significant difference in the outcome between the two groups, we may have evidence that there is a causal relationship between the treatment and the outcome. 15.5.2.1.3 Common study designs and how to recognize them 15.5.2.1.4 Causation from observational studies? Although well-designed randomized trials are the gold standard way to establish a causal relationship, observational studies can also help build evidence for causation. 15.5.2.1.4.1 Bradford Hill criteria (not assessed) Strength of association Consistency Specificity Temporality Biological gradient Plausibility Coherence Experiment Analogy Science is not a magic wand that turns everything it touches to truth. Instead, “science operates as a procedure of uncertainty reduction,” said Nosek, of the Center for Open Science. “The goal is to get less wrong over time.” This concept is fundamental — whatever we know now is only our best approximation of the truth. We can never presume to have everything right. From the Science isn’t broken reading for this module (Aschwanden, 2015). Source: https://xkcd.com/552/ 15.5.2.2 Human research ethics Ethical codes often emerge out of crisis events. The Nuremberg code was formulated in August 1947 in Nuremberg, Germany, by American judges12 sitting in judgment of Nazi doctors accused of conducting murderous and torturous human experiments in concentration camps during the war. The Nuremberg code codified many of our standard principles of ethical research, including: + research must appropriately balance risk and potential benefits + researchers must be well-versed in their discipline and ground human experiments in animal trials. 15.5.2.2.1 Principles of free and informed consent 15.5.2.2.1.1 Information The research procedure, risks and anticipated benefits, alternative procedures (where therapy is involved), and a statement offering the participant the opportunity to ask questions and to withdraw at any time from the research. 15.5.2.2.1.2 Comprehension The manner and context in which information is conveyed is as important as the information itself. For example, presenting information in a disorganized or rapid manner (with too little time to think about it or ask questions), may limit a participant’s ability to make an informed choice. 15.5.2.2.1.3 Voluntariness An agreement to participate in research constitutes a valid consent only if it is voluntary; this requires conditions free of coercion and inappropriate influence. 15.5.2.3 Web scraping and APIs Web scraping (also known as web harvesting, web crawling or web data extraction) is any method of copying data from a webpage, usually to then store it in a spreadsheet or database. Downloading a ready-made .csv file hosted by a site wouldn’t be considered web scraping. (Although you might find a programmatic way to download many of these could be.) 15.5.2.3.1 What do you need to web scrape? Some knowledge of URLs, HTML and CSS URL - Universal Resource Locator HTML - HyperText Markup Language CSS - Cascading Style Sheets The rvest and polite packages in R (or Rcrawler, there may be others too) or Beautiful Soup for Python Professional ethics! 15.5.2.3.2 The Ethical Scraper I, the web scraper will live by the following principles: If you have a public API that provides the data I’m looking for, I’ll use it and avoid scraping all together. I will always provide a User Agent string that makes my intentions clear and provides a way for you to contact me with questions or concerns. I will request data at a reasonable rate. I will strive to never be confused for a DDoS attack. I will only save the data I absolutely need from your page. If all I need is OpenGraph meta-data, that’s all I’ll keep. I will respect any content I do keep. I’ll never pass it off as my own. I will look for ways to return value to you. Maybe I can drive some (real) traffic to your site or credit you in an article or post. I will respond in a timely fashion to your outreach and work with you towards a resolution. I will scrape for the purpose of creating new value from the data, not to duplicate it. Source: James Densmore, https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01 15.5.2.3.3 Terms and Conditions and Robots.txt Many sites give instructions about what you’re allowed and not allowed to do on them. One way is through the Terms and Conditions and another is through a file called robots.txt. T&amp;Cs Ideally, we should all be reading all the Terms and Conditions of all the websites we use…and of course I’m sure you dooooo. But when in a hurry, search (CTRL+F or CMD+F) “scrape,” “harvest” “crawl” and if none of those come up then “data” and “copied” more generally and that can give you a sense if they prohibit certain uses. 15.5.2.3.4 Robots.txt Most large websites have a robots.txt page to give instructions about what ‘robots’ are and aren’t allowed to visit the page. This is most often used for search engines, but we can check them too. Bad bots can still do what they want. More on these protocols (and templates you could add to your own site here). http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html (optional) An ethical scraper… + …follows the site’s terms and conditions and/or robots.txt. + …uses an API when provided. + …rate limits their requests. + I.e., respect a ‘crawl limit’ suggested by the site, 5 seconds is a polite default if not told otherwise. + …credits their sources. 15.5.2.3.5 Using an API API stands for a pplication p rogramming i nterface. It is a structured way for data (broadly) requests to be made and fulfilled with computers. I like this comparison to a restaurant menu. You don’t need to know HOW to make crème brûlée to be able to know you WANT it. If you are using an API, there still may be rules about things like how many requests you can make in a certain time frame and rate limiting. Make sure you’re aware of these rules and behave in the spirit of them! Optional reading (not assessed): https://beanumber.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-ethics.html#sec:terms-of-use 15.5.2.4 Indigenous data sovereignty Countries and nations tend to want data collected and stored about them/their people to be subject to their laws. You might see examples of this in how government agencies require any cloud storage they use to have the servers be based within their boundaries. This area of thinking is often called data sovereignty. Canada is one of many countries with a history of colonization by settler peoples and the displacement of, discrimination against, and in many cases mass murder of the Indigenous peoples. As countries like Canada go through processes of truth and reconciliation to address these violent and oppressive histories, indigenous data sovereignty has also become a growing area of thought. Why do statisticians needs to know about this? Because we must move from data gathering and analysis as further tools of oppression and be part of honouring the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples and nations over their own data. Be aware of Indigenous rights and interests in relation to data. Understand protocols for consulting with Indigenous peoples about data collection, access and use. Ensure data for and about Indigenous peoples we are given access to is safeguarded and protected. Support quality and integrity of Indigenous data and its collection. Advocate for Indigenous involvement in the governance of data repositories. Support the development of Indigenous data infrastructure and security systems. Several of these points are generalized from the Māori context in Aotearoa New Zealand. See https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/kaupapa. 15.5.2.4.1 How can U of T students develop their knowledge? While there aren’t yet specific data sovereignty trainings (we’re looking at developing these resources), there are several workshops, events and trainings you have access to. Go to https://clnx.utoronto.ca and check out the Events &amp; Workshops section. St George Calendars: First Nations House - Indigenous Student Services Tri-Campus Calendar: Indigenous Cultural Education Look for workshops with John Croutch and/or on the following topics: + Reconciliation: Walking the Path of Indigenous Allyship + Reflecting on Land Acknowledgements + Speaking Our Truths: The Journey Towards Reconciliation | 2 days P1 &amp; P2 As well as being important knowledge for working and living in the Canadian context, as we go forwards there is going to be a competitive disadvantage to being ignorant about these issues if seeking work in government, health and social agencies. Many private sector organizations are also making developing these competencies a priority in staff education. 15.5.2.5 Selection bias Selection bias can occur in a range of ways, but the key feature is that your sample is not representative of the population. Example: Suppose I want to email out a survey to investigate if U of T students think statistics is important for their future career. I only have the emails for students I teach…in statistics courses. If I randomly sample from this list of students, can I make claims about the population of all U of T students? No. Example: The healthy migrant effect. It has been noticed in many countries that migrants have mortality advantages over local-born populations. While there are several possible things going on and being researched in this area, these findings likely show a component of ‘selection bias’ in that usually only healthy people can migrate, either due to health screening requirements in the country to which they are migrating, or by people with health complications self-selecting out due to inability/disinclination. Survivorship bias is a specific type of selection bias. 15.5.2.5.1 Survivorship bias Note: There is a risk that I’m about to ruin a bunch of ‘inspirational’ internet content for you. If you’ve spent any time on LinkedIn, and probably lots of other social media sites, you’ve probably seen an image like this one. Is it inspiring? Sure, maybe…. BUT as an attempted claim about the value of failure it commits the logical error of focusing on just the people who eventually succeeded. I’m sure there are plenty of unemployed, divorced, university dropouts not writing Parry Hotter and the Windows OS… Click for source. 15.5.3 Analyzing data In our readings for this module, the reproducibility crisis, P-hacking and HARKing have been discussed. I won’t cover P-hacking or the reproducibilty crisis any further, as these readings are great introductions, but the next few slides talk a little more about HARKing and multiple testing problems. Motulsky, H.J., (2014). Common misconceptions about data analysis and statistics. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-014-1037-6 Aschwanden, C. (2015). Science Isn’t Broken: It’s just a hell of a lot harder than we give it credit for. Retrieved from https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken 15.5.3.1 HARKing HARKing is “H ypothesizing A fter the R esults are K nown.” I sometimes talk about this as the ‘no peeking rule’ in setting up hypotheses. For example, you should never pick a one-tailed hypothesis test because of your data, it should only be based on findings from previous studies or a physical theory of a phenomenon. There is a good introduction to this idea in the Motulsky paper you have been assigned for your portfolio assessment ). (Think the XKCD jelly bean comic!) There are critiques about whether HARKing is as harmful to science as sometimes claimed and a lot of yummy philosophy of science that we won’t go into. If you’re interested in this area, try reading Rubin (2017), “When Does HARKing Hurt? Identifying When Different Types of Undisclosed Post Hoc Hypothesizing Harm Scientific Progress” (optional). 15.5.3.2 Multiple testing problem One of my favourite examples of positive academic trolling is the dead salmon study. The study used methodology for exploring animal reactions to human emotions expressed in photographs through fMRI scans. If the researchers had ignored the issue of multiple comparisons (there are thousands of areas for which brain activation is measured) they might have ended up with test results that claimed the (dead) salmon was engaging in ‘perspective-taking’ when shown the photos of the humans. (It was not). See the poster here: http://prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.pdf This is the reason we would want to run an ANOVA when we have more than two groups to compare the means of, instead of doing multiple t-tests between every pair of levels and it is mentioned in conjunction with HARKing in Motulsky paper. But what is actually going on here? Suppose you’ve picked a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). When conducting just one test this means we’re accepting a 5% risk of making a Type 1 Error, that is, rejecting the null hypothesis when we shouldn’t. BUT, if we are conducting several tests at the same time, then we need to think about our family-wise error rate, which is our chance of making at least one Type 1 Error across all our tests. So, if you are making a Type 1 Error 5% of the time, the idea is that 95% of the time you’re not. And while 95% is pretty good, if you’re doing \\(m\\) independent tests, the not-making-an-error rate becomes \\(0.95^m\\), e.g., if you’re doing \\(20\\) tests, \\(0.95^{20}=0.359\\), meaning the chance of making at least one ‘false discovery’ is now \\(\\sim64\\%\\) 15.5.3.2.1 Correcting for multiple comparisons? There are multiple methods investigators employ in an effort to have their Type 1 Error across multiple tests actually reflect the error rate they are comfortable with. The simplest but most conservative of these is the Bonferroni correction where you just divide your significance level (e.g., 0.05) by the number of tests you are conducting and use that as the new significance cut off. E.g. If you’d usually use a 5% threshold and are doing 20 tests, your new threshold is \\[\\alpha_{adjusted} = \\frac{0.05}{20} = 0.0025.\\] As you can see, this is now a much stronger level of evidence we’re requiring against our null hypothesis than when doing a single test. 15.5.4 Making decisions with data 15.5.4.1 Algorithmic bias Prediction models are taught what they “know” from training data. Training data can be incomplete, biased, or skewed. This can result in algorithmic bias. 15.5.4.1.1 Proxy variables There can also be situations where we know we DON’T want to use a variable as part of an algorithm, for ethical and often legal reasons (anti-discrimination laws about gender, race, health status, e.g. American’s with Disabilities Act means you can’t discriminate against people with mental health conditions). BUT there might be other variables in your data, like certain types of hobbies/memberships, home address, ‘personality’ quiz questions, that act as ‘proxies’ for these things, meaning they end up determining outcomes even when you don’t want them to.

Some predictive algorithms give us more than just a prediction: they also give us some insight as to what factor(s) influenced the prediction. Examples you might have encountered in your studies already include linear regression models and classification trees. Other algorithms yield predictions, but no information about how it got from the inputs to the prediction, such as neural networks (you may see these in future courses). These are sometimes called ‘black box’ algorithms and many machine learning tools fall into this. We’ll briefly talk more about this when we discuss generalized additive models later in the course. What is more important—getting the most accurate predictions, or understanding the factor(s) which influence a prediction? When you approach a new statistical problem, try to figure out if you are aiming to make predictions, make inferences about relationships between variables, or provide informative summaries and descriptions of the data. 15.6 Statistical communication This section will be important to review as you work on your final project. You may want to scan it more quickly now and come back in more depth later in the semester. 15.6.1 Prioritize statistical communication as part of your toolbox While the technical skills of U of T statistics graduates are well received by employers. There is a common theme of communication skills not matching their business needs. This is part of the thinking behind the emphasis on writing in this course, your professional development task and the project, as well as providing opportunities to ‘talk stats’ in Team Up! groups. The section lays out some overarching tips about how to think about your role as a statistical communicator and some general tips about statistical reports, and their contents and structure. 15.6.1.1 What can statisticians learn about communication from Winston Churchill’s mother’s dinner conversation? In the lead up to a British election during the Victorian era, Jennie Jerome (Churchill’s mum) attended a dinner with the leader of the Conservatives, Benjamin Disraeli, and the leader of the Liberals, William Ewart Gladstone. She said: “When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman.” Who won that election? Disraeli.13 So, what can statisticians learn about communication from Winston Churchill’s mother’s dinner conversation? I think of this story often when working with clients. Especially early in my career, while I was still building my confidence, there was always the impulse to ‘show off’ my stats knowledge through jargon in some attempt to show that I was ‘worth the money’ clients were paying. And sure, you need to have substance and skill to do the job well. But always think of your job when communicating with non-statisticians as additionally one of education. You want repeat business? Or to impress your non-statistician manager? Then communicate in ways that helps them to ‘aha!’ moments. Have them leave you feeling cleverer about statistics than they thought they were coming in. Below is a screenshot from a talk Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti, @ChelseaParlett gave at the Toronto Data Workshop. These are the questions she asks herself when communicating about statistics and ones I think we should all ask ourselves, too. Parlett-Pelleriti, C. (2020) Talking to non-statisticians about statistics. Toronto Data Workshop presentation, September 24. 15.6.2 What do statisticians usually write? Statisticians must often write reports to summarize the results of scientific research or data analyses: Academia, health sciences, etc. Write “methods” section of collaborative papers. Present to research groups. Industry Create slide decks (either stand-alone or for presentation) summarizing results of data analyses / research for use within the company. Write reports summarizing results of data analyses / research for use within the company. 15.6.3 Common report components 15.6.3.1 Brief overview (ONE of the following, not both) 15.6.3.1.1 Abstract (or summary) These are common academic articles. Short and to the point Self-contained (i.e., someone could read this and only this and get the gist of your work) Emphasize conclusions rather than specific methods Approximately 100–200 words No figures, no tables, no/few references. 15.6.3.1.1.1 ‘Plain English’ summaries These are also becoming popular in some academic journals. Think of this as something a high school student could read and understand the purpose of the article. Nice suggestions + example here (optional).] 15.6.3.1.2 Executive summary You might see this more commonly in business or government contexts. It is a summary aimed at busy and non-technical ‘executives’ (for example) and would accompany or preface a more detailed technical report. Your ability to communicate flexibly to different audiences is very important here. Short and to the point Self-contained Use bullet points. Emphasize conclusions/recommendations. Might include the most important figures and tables, very carefully chosen. 15.6.3.2 Introduction Purpose: provides background information about the project/research. * Why was the investigation done? * What research questions are considered in the report (scope)? The final paragraph of the introduction should outline what is in the rest of the report. Think of it as the road map. Important: If you are consulting for a client/collaborator,14 don’t pretend to be an expert if you are not one! The purpose of this section is to provide context (as you understand it) for the rest of your report, so that the report is a complete document, and it is clear what you will and will not address. 15.6.3.3 Data summary (optional) Useful if you feel you need more details than you can reasonably give in the Introduction and/or what will be discussed in a Methods section. Purpose: describing the data, but not answering the research question (which you will put in the “Results” section). Might include: * Basic summary tables, graphs, and descriptive statistics. * Changes made to the data to make it suitable for analysis. * Discussion of decisions around missing data. * Large tables or series of graphs should go in an appendix, not in the main body of the report. 15.6.3.4 Methods Briefly describe the design of the scientific study, in the context of the analysis. If you’re writing for a collaborator, you don’t need to tell the collaborator what they did. Use this section for what you did! Resist the temptation to make a diary. This shouldn’t be a digest of everything you’ve done (only the key analyses which you wish to comment on in the results section). Do NOT include trivial information (e.g., \"The data in Excel were saved in a text file and read into R“). Be clear which methods were used for what purpose, related to the context of the project. This will likely need to be clarified further in the results section. The required level of detail depends on the statistical method. Basic/standard methods (e.g., t-tests, linear regression): do not need to explain. More advanced methods: explain the general motivating ideas in words; you are not writing a statistics textbook! A separate methods section is traditional in many scientific journals, but can be difficult (and frustrating) to write if it is too disconnected from the analysis. Sometimes it is better to describe the methods and results together. 15.6.3.5 Results Make sure this section is clearly organized, point-by-point, in paragraphs. Computer output NEVER goes in the body of the report, and RARELY in an appendix, though this depends on your audience/future users. I would encourage you to consider providing code in ‘supplementary materials’ as this can aid others with reproducing your results and learning from your work. Privacy and sensitivity of data considerations apply. Include graphs and small tables that tell the main story; less relevant graphs/tables should go in an appendix. If you include a figure/table, you must refer to it in the body of the report (NO lonely figures/tables!). Describe in words what the table/graph shows. If you find you are repeating all of the information that is in the graph or table, consider whether or not you need the graph or table. The purpose of figures and tables is to illustrate a pattern, which should be clear for someone looking at it. Figures and tables require clear labels and captions (not too small!). General advice/convention is that tables are read from top to bottom, and so table captions go on top of the table. Figures on the other hand are read ‘bottom to top’ and so figure captions go below the figure. If your image is not in a report (i.e. an info-graphic like our charts from the data exploration assessment) you might prefer to have a clear title (and subtitle) at the top instead of a caption. You may want to group similar graphs into a figure with sub-figures (e.g., Fig 1a, 1b —be sure that the labels/captions are large enough to read though) Describe results in words and include, parenthetically, the relevant statistics such as means with standard errors (or confidence intervals) or the test statistic with p-value. Round appropriately! What is an interesting or useful level of ‘granularity’ for this study?

Source: https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/financial-report/2019/executive-summary-2019.pdf 15.6.3.6 Conclusion/discussion Summarize what was learned regarding the research question. Discuss possible weaknesses/limitations in the study and/or analysis and specific suggestions for future considerations. If appropriate (often done in academic articles) discuss strengths/positive points of difference of this study also. Explain what the work was able to achieve and not able to achieve. 15.6.3.7 References Only include references that have been cited in the text. There are many different styles. I often use APA, but don’t really have any strong preference. Be consistent and head any instructions relevant to where you are publishing and/or norms in the company/industry/discipline you are working in. 15.6.3.8 Appendices Include tables and figures which would interrupt the flow of the report if they were included in the main body (e.g., less relevant, but still interesting) Keep in mind this is not a dumping ground. Only include graphs/tables which would be useful/interesting to your audience, and make sure any figures/tables you include there stand alone (e.g., with detailed titles and captions) and are supported by text if necessary. If you include an appendix, you should point to it in the body of the text, so that the reader knows when it is relevant to flip to it, if they want more information. 15.6.3.9 Final notes on organization The overall structure of most articles and reports? Say what you’re going to do and why, do it, say what you did (and what it means). The ordering of ideas should be consistent throughout your report. E.g., if there are multiple research questions in the introduction, they should be addressed in the same order in the methods, results, and conclusion. This is such a simple thing, but easy to forget in the moment. You could also combine the methods/results sections and organize your report by the question being answered (with one subsection for each question). In each subsection, state the methods used and the results. Having separate sections for methods and results makes more sense if the same methods are used repeatedly. Many people only read the introduction and conclusion (or at least they start there…) so make these sections are complete and self-contained. 15.6.4 Paraphrasing This section has been prepared by our Head TA, Amin. STA303 and Amin’s roll is supported by the Faculty of Arts and Science’s English Language Learning and Writing teams. If you have particular challenges or questions about writing and communication, let us know! We may be able to direct you to specific resources and/or make STA303 specific ones. This section will help you with your portfolio assessment and may also be useful as you take notes on the readings for this module. Paraphrasing is re-writing someone else’s statement in your own words. To paraphrase well you need to (1) provide a reference (avoid plagiarizing) and (2) understand the text and write in your own words and create new sentence structures. Recommended resource: https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/paraphrase/. 15.6.4.1 Example activity prompt Suppose you were asked to paraphrase the below text and provide your conclusions from the observations in the text and the graph in 100 to 200 words. The report is from Statistics Canada (Provencher, Milan, Hallman, &amp; D’Aoust, 2018): Note: To avoid plagiarism, I have: placed quotation marks (\"\") around the verbatim text copied and pasted below, and provided a reference in the previous sentence (Provencher, … 2018) and the complete citation at the end under “References.”] “The annual growth in the number of births in the past five years has fluctuated, compared with the period from 2002/2003 to 2008/2009, when it remained positive and stronger (2.1% on average). Between 2011 and 2012 and between 2013 and 2014, the number of births rose around 1.0% across Canada, while they fell 0.4% from 2012 to 2013 and from 2014 to 2015. There was only a small increase of 0.2% between 2015 and 2016. Since 2001, the total number of births fell only four times, in 2001/2002 and 2009/2010, and more recently in 2012/2013 and 2014/2015.” Source: Provencher, Milan, Hallman, &amp; D’Aoust, 2018 The following provides guidance on what poor, adequate and excellent paraphrasing could look like. You will be putting this into practice with your portfolio writing task. 15.6.4.1.1 Sample partial/complete answers with overall gradings 15.6.4.1.1.1 Poor Copying/pasting verbatim is NOT paraphrasing. In the following, there is no change in structure, just a few words replaced. “The annual growth yearly increase in the number of births in the past last five years has fluctuated varied, compared with in contrast to the period from…” 15.6.4.1.1.2 Adequate Changes in wording and structure but text is vague and does not help the reader understand the main points in context of location or time, nor does it provide the source of information. The number of births has fluctuated over time. There are times when the number is relatively high and sometimes it is relatively low. Not all increases were large with some being as little as 0.2%… This is adequate in that it is not obviously an academic integrity offence but it would not be particularly useful. 15.6.4.1.1.3 Excellent Changes in wording and structure. Provides a good overview. Conclusion with appropriate hedging: “…may have been a contributing factor…” A shorter version without explaining all the points would have been okay too. Stating the reason for observation is unknown and may require further inquiry would have been okay too. Based on the 2018 report provided by Statistics Canada, yearly birth growth in Canada was initially increasing from 2001/2002 up till 2008/2009 but then slowed down. At its peak, yearly birth growth reached nearly 4% while at its lowest, after 2008/2009, birth growth was even slightly negative at times. The number of births fell 4 times from 2001 to 2016, with 3 out of 4 of these times being in the second half of 2001 – 2016. All these observations point toward a possible change at that time to disrupt the trends midway in 2008. The timing of the lowering of birth numbers coincides with the 2008 financial crisis in Canada and this may have been a contributing factor as families may have not had the financial certainty to have kids. A close examination of contributing factors through research is needed to see if this is true. 15.6.4.2 How to think about paraphrasing? Based on a method suggested by (Swales &amp; Feak, 2012), identify: important points from the text, relationships, linking phrases, connectors, and synonyms. Below is an example of how you might have taken notes on the example paragraph to aid your paraphrasing. You don’t need to submit anything like this as part of your portfolio assessment. Submit the response to the prompt only. Please be aware that if you do not paraphrase correctly, you may receive a zero on the ENTIRE writing component. 15.6.4.2.1 Example using the Swales &amp; Feak (2012) approach Important points (your notes) Number of births has fluctuated in past 5 years. The first half of 2001 – 2016 period saw an average increase in births. The second half of 2001 – 2016 period saw an average increase in births. Number of births fell 4 times from 2001 to 2016, with 3 out of 4 of these times being in the second half of 2001 – 2016. Relationship between points Chronological order (more to less) Asymmetry in distribution of events Linking phrases and expressions to use in paraphrasing but while Verbs that might establish other relationships in paraphrasing Increase Decrease [not used, slowing down used instead] Coincides Possible synonyms to use when paraphrasing fluctuated → varied [+between, +around], changed [not used] compared with → in contrast to [not used] annual→ yearly rose / remained positive and stronger → increased Other considerations Who is the audience? You are ready to re-write the report in your own words! 15.6.4.3 References Provencher, C., Milan, A., Hallman, S., &amp; D’Aoust, C. (2018). Report on the Demographic Situation in Canada.

Discuss partitioning of sources of variability in mixed models. Identify situations where linear mixed models may be needed. Create plots to explore hierarchical data. Write the formula for LMMs. Fit LMMs with the lmer function using random slopes and random intercepts, as appropriate. Interpret the results of lmer outputs. Conduct appropriate tests to compare LMMs. Polish your professional writing. 16.2 Introduction This module recaps a few topics you should have encountered in previous courses: * statistical independence and correlated data, * specifically, from your understanding of the context/collection of data, can you identify whether observations are likely to be independent?, and * maximum likelihood/maximum likelihood estimation . It also introduces an extension to regression, the linear mixed model, that uses maximum likelihood estimation to allow us to more flexibly deal with correlated data, that would violate our independence assumptions. 16.2.1 How deep are we going on likelihoods? We’ll need the concept of maximum likelihood for most of the models we’ll meet in this course. That said, proofs about MLEs are not the focus of this course. You should have encountered the concept of likelihood in STA238: Probability, Statistics and Data Analysis II OR STA261: Probability and Statistics II. Having taken one of these is a pre-req for STA302, which is the pre-req for STA303. For more depth on this important and useful topic (mathematically and/or computationally) consider taking: STA355: Theory of Statistical Practice, and/or STA410: Statistical Computation, and/or STA422: Theory of Statistical Inference and/or STA452: Mathematical Statistics I + STA453: Mathematical Statistics II These recommendations are based only on the calendar entries for these courses, the latest syllabi of these courses are probably your best guide to what is covered. 16.2.1.1 Maximum likelihood review \\[L(\\theta) = f(x | \\theta) \\] * Likelihood helps us understand how well our model fits our data. * Maximizing the likelihood function estimates the coefficient values for our model that make the data we actually observed the most likely. * That might feel a little backwards, as you could say the chance of observing out data is 100%, because we did…observe it…but hopefully the idea of picking the coefficient estimates for our model that make our data the most likely makes some sense. 16.2.1.2 Properties of maximum likelihood estimators For large sample sizes: Bias goes to 0 (as sample size increases) Approximately minimum variance Approximately normal distribution (usually) Another nice feature of MLEs are that they are ‘invariant’ under transformation. This means that if \\(\\hat\\theta\\) is an MLE of \\(\\theta\\), and \\(g\\) is a 1-1 function, then \\(g(\\hat\\theta)\\) is an MLE of \\(g(\\theta)\\). This will come in handy in future modules when we want to transform our coefficient estimates with link functions. 16.2.1.3 Suggested reading As this should mostly be a recap of likelihood, this is a great article on which to practice your previewing and skimming strategies. You may want to pay special attention to the likelihood ratio test. Chapter 2 (§ 2.1–2.9) of Roback, P. &amp; Legler, J. Beyond Multiple Linear Regression. (2021). Retrieved from: https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ (Links to an external site.) 16.2.2 Model comparison more generally Thank you to TA Ian for developing this section! He applies statistics in his own research in ecology. Model selection is a key component of the development of any statistical model. In model development, there may be multiple plausible hypotheses that can be evaluated simultaneously by parameterizing different models with the same data. These candidate models can differ in both fixed and random effects however the models generally have a similar structure (e.g., multiple combinations of a set of fixed effects). To test the hypotheses with the candidate models, one must determine and compare the support for each model to determine which model(s) fit the observed data the best. While the likelihood-ratio test is suitable when comparing two models to one another, there are certain situations when the goal is to compare multiple (&gt; 2) models to identify the model that best fits the data. There are many different criteria for model selection that can be used. Measures such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), adjusted \\(R^2\\), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) measure the goodness of fit of the model to the data whereas others are focused on calculating the predictive performance of the model (e.g., prediction error rate, root mean square error). Model selection criteria focus on model fit however some will also consider model complexity as model fit generally increases with an increase in the number of model parameters. The selection of the appropriate criteria is generally dependent on the type of model and the purpose of model development (i.e. inference or prediction). For this course, we will use likelihood ratio tests as well as the information-theoretic (I-T) approach using AIC for model selection. AIC measures the lack of model fit to the data based on the log-likelihood of the model while penalizing for the number of parameters in the model. Lower AIC values indicate that the model strongly fits the observed data whereas a higher value indicates a poor model fit. The absolute AIC values can be challenging to interpret so the values are compared relative to one another. Among the candidate models, identify the lowest AIC value (\\(AIC_{min}\\)}) and calculate the differences between \\(AIC_{min}\\) and the AIC values of every candidate model (\\(AIC_{i}\\)) to obtain AIC differences (\\(\\Delta\\)AIC) for each model. In general, large values of \\(\\Delta\\)AIC (&gt; 10) indicate no support for the model, models with intermediate values (4-7) have little support, and models with small values (0-3) have strong support. These categories are arbitrary and may differ among studies. There are scenarios where multiple models have similar support and there is no considerable difference among the model selection criteria. These models would then represent plausible models and support their associated hypotheses. Additionally, model weights can be calculated to evaluate the relative support of each model by the data. Larger weights indicate that the model is strongly supported by the data whereas small values suggest the model poorly fits the data. 16.2.2.0.1 References Burnham, K. P., Anderson, D. R., &amp; Huyvaert, K. P. (2011). AIC model selection and multimodel inference in behavioral ecology: some background, observations, and comparisons.

Retrieved from: https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ 16.3.2 Key vocabulary Fixed effects: These are non-random quantities. All the coefficients you were estimating in STA302 are examples of fixed effects as you were not treating \\(\\beta_1\\) as a random variable, for example. Random effects: These ARE random quantities. These model parameters are treated as random variables. Mixed effects model: A model that includes both fixed and random effects as its parameters. These are also called hierarchical models and just mixed models. They are NOT the same as mixed methods, which is a ‘mix’ of quantitative and qualitative research methodology. Nested/nesting design: Observational units are grouped within grouping units. There may be multiple levels of grouping. Crossed effect design: Every observational unit experiences every level of the treatment variable. Observational units: The person or thing on which your outcome of interest is measured. In an experiment we might also call this the ‘experimental unit’ or some might say ‘statistical unit.’ In Chapter 7 of Beyond Multiple Linear Regression, these are referred to as ‘level-one observational units.’ E.g. In a survey of our class, each student is the observational unit. When I am preparing my final grades, each assessment for each student is my unit of observation. This links back to tidy data (week 2). We want each observational unit to have its own row and only that one row. Grouping units: How your observational units are grouped together. In Chapter 7 of Beyond Multiple Linear Regression, these are referred to as ‘level-two observational units,’ but you could have even more levels of grouping. Groups within groups, etc. 16.4 Statdew Valley interactive Click this text to go to the interactive Note: A ‘static’ version of this interactive follows, to aid review, but I recommend you work through the interactive the first time. 16.4.1 Welcome to Statdew Valley! You’re grandmother has asked you to take over her old farm plot in Statdew Valley. Armed with statistical knowledge, you set out to begin your new life! There are two of datasets for you to analyze to better understand the operation of your farm. Note: The final ‘hint’ for code chunks will be the solution. Yes, this is totally an homage to Stardew Valley. Have I played? No, but à la Girlfriend Reviews on YouTube, this is based on “what it’s like to live with someone who plays Stardew Valley.” 16.4.2 Optional: Create your 16 bit character You can use R for so much more than just running regressions! This section is totally optional, and definitely not assessed. Copy this code into a separate .Rmd. It won’t work from within a Shiny App (this interactive). Save the .Rmd and make sure it is in a folder, not in your Home directory. Rmd files in your Home directory will cause interactives to fail. Choose an image to pixelate to get your character. You’ll need to have a URL for it (or you could edit the code for a local file). I think it is easiest to upload to GitHub (or Google Photos) and then right click to copy the image address. Play with the Shiny app interface for the pixelart package to help you get the settings right. Update these settings in the code below. [Super super optional] Post your character on the optional discussion board for this week. If you have a Stardew Valley character or some other pixel art of yourself, you can share that, too. This is just for fun, no requirement to participate. Please be sensible about making sure any images are appropriate. Don’t use images of other people, etc. Is this GOOD character pixel art? No. But I think it is cool that you can do image manipulation in R! 16.4.3 Task 1: Tomatoes (part 1) Suppose your farm has a small experimental tomato patch. You are interested in knowing if there is any difference between the weight of tomatoes produced from plants that are fertilized with basic fertilizer vs tomatoes produced from plants that are fertilized with quality fertilizer. Tee patch has two plots, one for each fertilizer type. In each plot there are three tomato plants (all of the same species). Other growth influencing factors, like light exposure and precipitation are the same for each plot. 4 tomatoes were chosen at random from each plant and weighed (reported in grams). This data is stored in tomatoes. Layout of tomato patch glimpse(tomatoes) ## Rows: 24 ## Columns: 3 ## $ plant &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5,… ## $ fertilizer &lt;chr&gt; &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;basi… ## $ weight &lt;dbl&gt; 123.0, 124.0, 128.0, 125.0, 135.0, 140.0, 129.0, 131.0, 146… 16.4.3.1 Plot the tomat-ah dat-ah Create a plot with plant on the x axis, weight on the y axis and coloured by fertilizer type. Choose a sensible geometry. I also used theme_minimal() because I like the way it looks. This is just an exploratory plot for our benefit, so it can be a bit rough. No title, etc. tomatoes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = plant, y = weight, colour = fertilizer)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() Note: We’re going to take a pretty STA302 approach here. We’ll start out by doing something WRONG and then improve it in the next section, still under the least squares framework. We can do this BECAUSE this is what is called a ‘balanced data’ design. That is, there is an equal number of observations in each combination of levels: 4 tomatoes per plant per fertilizer type plot. 16.4.3.2 The WRONG approach: fixed effects only Fertilizer is our variable of interest, so we need to include it in the model, but we might expect that tomatoes from the same plant are more similar to each other in weight than tomatoes from different plants. This also seems believable based on the plot. So, let’s start by proposing a model like this: 16.4.3.2.1 Model \\[y_{i} = \\alpha_j + \\beta_k + \\epsilon_{i} \\] where \\(y_{i}\\) is the weight of the \\(i^{th}\\) tomato from plant \\(k\\) in fertilizer plot \\(j\\). Here, \\(\\alpha_j\\) is the population mean weight for fertilizer plot \\(j\\) and \\(\\beta_k\\) is the difference of plant \\(k\\) from that mean. The two longer horizontal lines in this graph represent \\(\\alpha_{basic}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{quality}\\) respectively. Each plant also has a shorter horizontal line shown which represents the mean weight of tomatoes from that plant. The distances (shown with the 6 vertical lines) are the \\(\\beta\\) values discussed above. (You’re not required to be able to create this plot right now. If you’re curious you can see the code in the .Rmd version of this activity.) Figure 16.1: Figure: Visual representation of the equation for this data Now, this probably looks a little different to how you’ve been writing models, but I hope it makes sense as describing the data that we’re interested in. Question: Could we use this model to predict the average weight of tomatoes from a new plant (e.g. plant 7) grown in the quality fertilizer? Answer: No We have no coefficient for plant 7, so no, this model as it is currently won’t help us make predictions for any plants other than the ones we’ve observed.\" Question: Is this model identifiable as currently set out? That is, is there only one possible set of values that we could set these parameters to to get the correct response value? Answer: No. The \\(\\beta_k\\) s are completely nested within our fertilizer levels, with three plants in the ‘basic’ fertilizer plot and three in the ‘quality fertilizer plot.’ Why is the a problem? In trying to fit these values, you’ll end up with an infinite number of possible values, because you can add any value to \\(\\alpha_{basic}\\) and subtract the same value from \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\) and \\(\\beta_3\\) to get the same value of \\(y\\). (Likewise for the ‘quality’ fertilizer plot and associated plants). Our model conceptualized in this way will not be identifiable.\" 16.4.3.3 Let’s try some models: Part 1 Fit a model called tom1 with weight as the outcome and fertilizer and plant as the predictors. Make sure plant is treated as a categorical (factor) variable, not numeric. Fit a model called tom2 with weight as the outcome and and just fertilizer as the predictor. Compare these models using ANOVA. tom1 &lt;- lm(weight ~ as_factor(plant) + fertilizer, data = tomatoes) tom2 &lt;- lm(weight ~ fertilizer, data = tomatoes) anova(tom1, tom2) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Model 1: weight ~ as_factor(plant) + fertilizer ## Model 2: weight ~ fertilizer ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) ## 1 18 411.62 ## 2 22 2192.29 -4 -1780.7 19.467 2.41e-06 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Question: Is there any evidence against the hypothesis that a model with fertilizer alone fits the data as well as the model with both plant and fertilizer? A. “Yes, we have evidence against the fertilizer only model being just as good. B.”No, we can proceed with the fertilizer only model. Answer: The p-value from our ANOVA above, 2.41e-06, suggests that there is strong evidence against there being no plant effect. Which means that we can’t separate whether the fertilizer is having an effect or not, with this model. To emphasize the problem further, let’s fit another model Fit tom3, that predicts weight with plant (as a factor) as the only independent variable. Run an anova to compare tom1 and tom3 tom1 &lt;- lm(weight ~ as_factor(plant) + fertilizer, data = tomatoes) tom3 &lt;- lm(weight ~ as_factor(plant), data = tomatoes) anova(tom1, tom3) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Model 1: weight ~ as_factor(plant) + fertilizer ## Model 2: weight ~ as_factor(plant) ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) ## 1 18 411.62 ## 2 18 411.62 0 0 Question: Think carefully about tom1 and tom3. Which ONE of the following statements is TRUE based on the results of your ANOVA, above? A. We have very strong evidence against the claim that the plant only model fits the data as well as the model with plant and fertilizer. B. We have no evidence against the claim that the plant only model fits the data as well as the model with plant and fertilizer, and so it appears there isn’t a difference between the fertilizers. C. Because of the nesting of plant within fertilizer, these models are actually really the SAME model and comparing them tells us nothing about the fertilizer. Answer: C. These models actually are the SAME in terms of the information they have, because of the total nesting of plants within fertilizer plots. You’ll notice the residual degrees of freedom are the same. So it is true that comparing them tells us nothing about fertilizer effects. 16.4.3.4 Summary Approaching our model in this way has several problems. Our model isn’t identifiable. In fact, if you run summary(tom1), you’ll see that the fertilizer coefficient is NA because of this! Oops. What we can model isn’t that useful to us, because it doesn’t generalize to any new plants. (E.g., we can’t say anything about a plant 7.) If we just fit the model is fertilizer, we know our independence assumption is violated and don’t know how much of a problem that will be for us. (Violated because we know observational units, tomatoes, are not independent when they come from the same plant.) So, do we give up on our first farming task? Nope! 16.4.4 Task 1: Tomatoes (part 2) 16.4.4.1 The RIGHT approach: mixed effects To approach this problem better, let us take a step back and realize that we really want to treat fertilizer and plant differently. Fertilizer is a classic fixed effect kind of variable. We want to be able to treat the parameter as fixed and we want to be able to use it to generalize so we can make claims about whether or not there is a difference between the fertilizers. Meanwhile, we’re not really that interested in the effects of each of these plants. We want information that will help us make decisions for future plants. What if we plant 20 new tomato plants? We want to be able make data driven claims in that case, too, not just for these 6 plants. BUT we also can’t ignore the plant effects (independence assumption, as discussed). Our solution? Treat plant effect as a random variable. We can think of these 6 plants as drawn from the population of all tomato plants (of this species, in these conditions). We can then understand each of their effects as an independent observation from this distribution. Decision: We will model fertilizer as a fixed effect and plant as a random effect. 16.4.4.1.1 Model This looks like: \\[ y_i = \\alpha_j + b_k + \\epsilon_i\\] where, again, \\(y_{i}\\) is the weight of the \\(i^{th}\\) tomato from plant \\(k\\) in fertilizer plot \\(j\\). Here, \\(\\alpha_j\\) is again the population mean weight for fertilizer plot \\(j\\) BUT \\(b_k \\sim N(0, \\sigma_b^2)\\) and \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). \\(b_k\\) and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) are mutually independent. Because we’re in ‘statistical easy mode’ (balanced design) with this example, we can actually achieve all of this in the framework of ordinary least squares you learned in STA302. FIRST we have to do some data manipulation. Question: Can you guess what we need to do to our data? A. Calculate average weight by fertilizer type and refit with formula weight_avg ~ plant B. Calculate average weight by plant and refit with formula weight_avg ~ fertilizer C. Calculate average weight by plant and fertilizer and refit with formula weight_avg ~ 1 Answer: We want to aggregate the data such that we have one value for each plant, the average weight of tomatoes from that plant. Then we will fit the model with the formula weight_avg ~ fertilizer. Create a new dataset called tom_agg from the tomatoes dataset. Group by both fertilizer and plant. Because plant is fully nested in fertilizer, this is just a convenient way to keep the fertilizer variable in the dataset. Summarize so you get the mean tomato weight for each plant. Call this variable weight_avg. Run glimpse(tom_agg). Before you run the code, see if you can predict what the output should look based on these instructions. Question: What will the new tom_agg data set look like? A. There will be one row for each plant, so 6 rows total. Three columns, for fertilizer, plant and weight_avg.\", correct = TRUE), B. There will be one row for each plant and fertilizer combination, so 2*6 = 12 rows total. Three columns, for fertilizer, plant and weight_avg.“), C. There will still be 24 rows and the original three columns, but now there will be an additional weight_avg column.”), D. We can’t predict how many rows there will be, but there should be 3 columns. Answer: Run the code and see! (or see below) tom_agg &lt;- tomatoes %&gt;% group_by(fertilizer, plant) %&gt;% summarize(weight_avg = mean(weight), .groups = &quot;drop&quot;) glimpse(tom_agg) ## Rows: 6 ## Columns: 3 ## $ fertilizer &lt;chr&gt; &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, &quot;quality&quot; ## $ plant &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ## $ weight_avg &lt;dbl&gt; 125.000, 133.750, 144.125, 140.375, 162.500, 156.500 Now that you’ve created the new appropriately aggregated dataset, tom_agg, use it to fit a model called tom_final that predicts weight_avg from fertilizer. Then run summary() on it. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the effect of using quality fertilizer over basic fertilizer. tom_final &lt;- lm(weight_avg ~ fertilizer, data = tom_agg) summary(tom_final) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = weight_avg ~ fertilizer, data = tom_agg) ## ## Residuals: ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## -9.2917 -0.5417 9.8333 -12.7500 9.3750 3.3750 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

A. We have weak evidence against the claim that fertilizer type has no effect on tomato weight. B. It is plausible, at the 95% confidence level, that on average, quality fertilizer produces tomatoes that are 10 grams heavier than tomatoes grown in basic fertilizer. C. At the 5% significance level we fail to reject the hypothesis that the average weight of tomatoes grown each fertilizer type is the same. D. Using a 5% significance level here, there is a chance that we are making a type II error. E. More than one of the above. Answer: All of these are actually correct! A) If using a ‘strength’ approach instead of a reject/fail to reject one, we often say a p-value between 0.1 and 0.05 is ‘weak evidence.’ B) 10 is in our 95% confidence interval, so it is a ‘plausible’ or believable value, because a CI is a range of plausible values for our parameter. C) Our p-value is larger than 0.05, so we fail to reject it at the 5% level. D) Because we are failing to reject the null, there is a chance that we’re wrong, and we SHOULD have rejected the null. Failing to reject the null when you should is a type II error. I remember this with ‘fail 2 reject -&gt; type 2’ 16.4.4.2 Variance of our random effect When we are conducting mixed effects models, we’re often interested in the variability of our random effects. So, we want to estimate \\(\\sigma_b^2\\) from the model above. Firstly, we can think about what variability that isn’t explained by our fixed effects. This is our residual variance. We get this from squaring the residual standard error in tom_final. This value is actually partitioned into two independent sources of variability, \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), the variance of our random error, and \\(\\hat{\\sigma_b}^2\\), the variance of our random effect. While you can derive this yourself if you like, let’s also take as true the following: \\[\\frac{\\text{RSS}_{tom\\_final}}{4} = \\hat{\\sigma_b}^2 + \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{4} \\]. The following just reruns the final code from the tasks above so I can use it. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = weight_avg ~ fertilizer, data = tom_agg) ## ## Residuals: ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## -9.2917 -0.5417 9.8333 -12.7500 9.3750 3.3750 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The random error variance is divided by the degrees of freedom of the final model. \\[\\text{RSE}_{tom\\_final}^2 = \\frac{\\text{RSS}_{tom\\_final}}{4} = \\hat{\\sigma_b}^2 + \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^2}{4}\\] \\[ = \\hat{\\sigma_b}^2 + \\frac{\\text{RSS}_{tom1}}{18}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}\\] \\[\\hat{\\sigma_b}^2 = \\text{RSE}_{tom\\_final}^2 - \\text{RSE}^2_{tom1} \\cdot\\frac{1}{4}\\] ## [1] 105.5747 So, \\(\\hat{b} \\sim N(0,\\) 105.57 \\()\\) . As you might expect, a lot of the variance in tomato weight that we can’t account for just based on the fertilizer is due to plant-to-plant variation 16.4.5 Task 2: Life is sweet as honey Your grandmother was a bit eccentric when it came to farm management. She swore that her bees produced more honey if she played them music in the morning. In fact, she even mentioned that she thought they particularly liked K-pop. She left you some data that she thinks proves this. While the sample size isn’t that large, you decide to take a look anyways. The data is called honey and records the honey produced each month for each of her 6 hives (in grams). Each hive listened to each of the song options (Butter by BTS, Adagio in B minor by Mozart and No music) for a month, three times. The order was randomized for each hive. It took 9 months to collect this data and the information your grandmother left you says honey production should have been fairly constant over this period and that all the hives experienced the same weather conditions, food access, etc. (Note: this is definitely not accurate to how beekeeping or weather actually works…but ignore this for our purposes.) ## Rows: 54 ## Columns: 3 ## $ hive &lt;fct&gt; 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1,… ## $ song &lt;fct&gt; No music, No music, No music, No music, No music, No music, No… ## $ honey_g &lt;dbl&gt; 196.56, 199.58, 200.71, 195.80, 199.58, 200.71, 226.80, 227.55… 16.4.5.1 Wrangle and plot the data Wrangle the honey data so that the song variable is a factor in this order: No music, Adagio in B minor by Mozart and Butter by BTS. Make hive a factor variable also. Save this over the original honey dataset. Then, using your new version of the honey dataset, create a new dataset called honey_agg_int, where you group by hive and song and summarize to find the average amount of honey produced by each hive while listening to a given song. Call your averaged variable honey_avg. honey &lt;- honey %&gt;% mutate(song = fct_relevel(song, &quot;No music&quot;, after = 0)) %&gt;% mutate(hive = as_factor(hive)) honey_agg_int &lt;- honey %&gt;% group_by(hive, song) %&gt;% summarize(honey_avg = mean(honey_g), .groups = &quot;drop&quot;) Plot the honey_agg_int data with song on the x axis and honey_avg on the y axis. In your aesthetic, you should also colour by hive and group by hive. (See the hint if you get stuck). Use the point and line geometries. Use theme_minimal() if you like. # This assumes you&#39;ve run the correct code for the wrangling above honey_agg_int %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = song, y = honey_avg, colour = hive, group = hive)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + theme_minimal() We’ve actually made an interaction plot for our data. There is a function in the core stats package that also does this for us. Question: What has us worried about the independence assumption if we were just going to do regression as usual? A. We don’t expect honey production while listening to the same song to be independent. B. We don’t expect production for a given hive to be independent from month to month. C. We don’t expect these observations to be independent because they all experienced the same weather conditions and food availability. D. No concerns about the independence assumption. Answer: B. We expect that some hives will be more productive than others, naturally; a ‘hive’ effect. We want to estimate if there is in fact an effect of song, so that isn’t an independence violation. We’re glad the other conditions that could affect honey production were similar across the whole period for all hives as this means any difference we see is likely due to song effect (once we account for hive effect), not weather fluctuations. This data is an example of crossed effects, because every hive experiences every level of the ‘treatment,’ i.e. each hive listens to each song. Question: What would a completely nested version of this study look like? A. This is both nested and crossed already. B. Assign hives 1, 2 and to listen to randomly swap between no music for and then Mozart for 9 months. Hives 4, 5 and 6 would be similar but BTS instead of Mozart. C. Repeated measures (x9) of honey production on each hive, listening to the same song, for 9 months. D. Not possible to design a nested version. Answer: C. You can’t be nested and crossed for the same grouping variable. A fully nested version of this would be much like our tomato study, with two hives assigned to each song. 16.4.5.2 Model formula This looks like: \\[ y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + b_{j} + + (\\alpha b)_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ijk}\\] where \\(y_{ijk}\\) is the amount of honey produced (in grams) in the \\(k^{th}\\) month by the \\(j^{th}\\) hive while listening to song \\(i\\). Here, \\(\\mu\\) is the grand mean of honey production, \\(\\alpha_i\\) are the \\(I\\) fixed effects for song and \\(b_j\\) are the random effects for hive \\(j\\). \\((\\alpha b)_{ij}\\) are the \\(IJ\\) interaction terms for the interaction between the the hive and the song. What does this represent here? Well, maybe some hives respond to a certain song quite differently to other hives. \\((\\alpha b)_{ij}\\) is a random effect because any term involving a random effect must also be a random effect. \\((\\alpha b)_{ij} ~ \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\alpha b})\\), \\(b_k \\sim N(0, \\sigma_b^2)\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{ijk} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). All the random effects are mutually independent random variables. 16.4.5.3 Fit the models Fit an interaction model (main effects and interactions) to predict honey production based on song and hive. Call it bee_int_mod. Fit a main effects (no interactions) model to predict honey production based on song and hive (no interaction). Call it bee_main. Compare these two models with ANOVA. ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Model 1: honey_g ~ song * hive ## Model 2: honey_g ~ song + hive ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) ## 1 36 475.5 ## 2 46 6570.0 -10 -6094.5 46.141 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Question: What do you think we can claim from the analysis above? A. It seems unlikely that the variance for the interaction terms is 0. B. There is no evidence against the hypothesis that the main effects model fits the data as well as the interaction model. C. These models are not identifiable. Answer: A. Because the the model with the interaction explains the data significantly better than the main effects only model, we can say it seems like the variability explained by the interaction is going to be important, i.e. we need interaction terms because they aren’t all the same value (which is how we’d have zero variance). These models are identifiable. (Run a summary on them, you’ll get no errors.) 16.4.5.4 Model with our aggregated data Run a new model using the honey_agg_int data, where honey_avg is the response and song and hive are fixed effects, no interactions. Save the model as bee_agg_mod. Run an ANOVA on bee_agg_mod. bee_agg_mod &lt;- lm(honey_avg ~ song + hive, data = honey_agg_int) anova(bee_agg_mod) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: honey_avg ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## song 2 8360.1 4180.1 20.576 0.0002855 *** ## hive 5 5914.7 1182.9 5.823 0.0089508 ** ## Residuals 10 2031.5 203.1 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The very low p-values you’ll see above suggest that we can also reject \\(H_0: \\sigma^2_b = 0\\) and \\(H_0: \\alpha_{BTS} = \\alpha_{Mozart} = \\alpha_{no\\ song} = 0\\) because it seems plausible that there is hive-to-hive variation, and that there are differences in honey production between the songs. 16.4.5.5 Describing our residuals Recall the formula for the residual sum of squares (RSS): \\[RSS = \\Sigma^{n}_{i=1} \\color{green}{e_i}^2 = \\Sigma^{n}_{i=1} (\\color{orange}{y_i} - \\color{blue}{\\hat{y_i}})\\] where: \\(\\color{green}{e_i}\\) is the residual for observation \\(i\\) \\(\\color{orange}{y_i}\\) is the observed value of the response variable for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation \\(\\color{blue}{\\hat{y_i}}\\) is the predicted value (from the model) for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation 16.4.5.5.1 Calculate the residual sum of squares for the bee_int_mod model. Save it as rss_int. rss_int &lt;- sum((honey$honey_g - predict(bee_int_mod))^2) \\[RSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{RSS}{\\color{red}n-\\color{blue}p-1}}\\] where: \\(RSS\\) is the residual sum of squares \\(\\color{red}n\\) is the number of observations in your dataset (that are being used for the model, must be complete cases for the variables being used) \\(\\color{blue}p\\) is the number of coefficients being estimated in our model (not including the intercept) 16.4.5.5.2 Calculate the RSE for the bee_int_mod model. Start by getting the sample size from the data (i.e., don’t ‘hard code’ it). Save it as n_int. Hint: nrow() is a useful function for finding the number of rows of a dataset. Calculate the degrees of freedom for your model. This is ‘easy’ (for a given value of easy…) to do by hand for balanced designs, but not something you’ll do for more complicated models in practice. Hint: \\(n-p-1\\) Save the value as df_int Finally, use these objects and rss calculated above to calculate the RSE. Save the object as rse_int. You can check if you are right by comparing to the RSE from the fitted model: Residual standard error: 3.634 on 36 degrees of freedom You can also check it directly with summary(bee_int_mod)$sigma # Number of observations n_int &lt;- nrow(honey) n_int ## [1] 54 # Degrees of freedom for the model df_int &lt;- n_int - nrow(summary(bee_int_mod)$coefficients) df_int ## [1] 36 # Calculate RSE rse_int &lt;- sqrt(rss_int/(df_int)) rse_int ## [1] 3.63432 # Check RSE from the model summary(bee_int_mod) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = honey_g ~ song * hive, data = honey) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -8.4400 -1.9533 0.1883 1.7300 9.0700 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

We will have a variance component for every one of our random effects (and interactions between a fixed and random effect are also random effects themselves!) as well as the overall residual variance. We can use this to claim what proportion of variance is explained by our different random effects and what proportion remains unexplained by our variables. I practice, we’ll let R handle this for us, especially as things will get a little messier when we leave the safety of balanced designs. See the Wood reading referenced in the credits if you want to cover this further now. Optional, not assessed. Basically, I want you to take away from this section that we can estimate how much our different sources of variation are each contributing to our overall variation. 16.4.5.6.2 Unexplained variance after fitting the interaction model As we saw above, our unexplained variability, after fitting the interaction model (the most complicated linear model possible for this data), bee_int_mod, gives us our \\(\\sigma^2\\), i.e., the variability of the error term is \\(\\sigma^2 = 3.63^2\\). Save the squared residual standard error from the bee_int_mod model as var_int. var_int &lt;- summary(bee_int_mod)$sigma^2 var_int ## [1] 13.20828 16.4.5.6.3 RSE for main effects model on aggregated data Next, we want to consider the what portion of the variability is explained by the interaction of hive and song. Our bee_agg_mod residual variance will come from two sources: the variance that CAN be explained by the interaction of hive and song AND the variability we cannot explain (even with out most complicated model), our random error. \\[\\text{RSE}_{bee\\_agg}^2 = \\sigma_{\\alpha b}^2 + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{K} \\] So, \\(\\text{RSE}_{bee\\_agg}\\) is the sigma value calculated from our main effects only model on the aggregated data, and \\(K\\) is the number of observations at each level of our interaction, i.e., the number of levels we have averaged over in aggregating this data. We want this value as we can use it to take the average of the squared errors from our interaction model (remember that \\(sigma^2\\) is the RSE squared.) We can get \\(K\\) from the context, by understanding that each hive was exposed to each song for 3 months and honey production was measured monthly. OR we can remember that this design is balanced and divide the total sample size (\\(n = 54\\)) by the number of combinations (levels of interaction) which will be 6 hives times 3 songs, which is then \\(\\frac{54}{6\\cdot 3} = 3\\). Doing some rearranging, we now can calculate \\(\\sigma_{\\alpha b}^2\\) from other values we have available to us. \\[\\sigma_{\\alpha b}^2 = \\text{RSE}_{bee\\_agg}^2 - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{K} = \\] 198.75 Calculate \\(\\sigma_{\\alpha b}^2\\) and save it as var_ab. var_ab &lt;- summary(bee_agg_mod)$sigma^2 - var_int / 3 var_ab ## [1] 198.7458 16.4.5.6.4 Hive-to-hive variance Finally, to get \\(\\sigma^2_{b}\\) we do one final aggregation and model. Start by creating a new dataset called honey_agg_hive.

Of the three variances for our random effects, the variance for the hive effect is the largest, and so explains the greatest proportion of the variability in honey production not explained by the song differences.\" 16.4.5.7 Summary Note the below notation is is based on using least squares and treating all variables as fixed effects. This isn’t the way you would explain a linear model in practice, but I hope helps you see how we are thinking about partitioning our variance. It also helps remind us that regression is just fancy averaging. Link to tweet Note: The \\(\\cdot\\) you’ll see in some of the following subscripts indicate where we are aggregating and averaging across that level of the data. 16.4.5.7.1 Full interaction model (includes main effects) (bee_int_mod) In R Notation RSE lm(honey_g ~ song*hive, data = honey) \\(y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + b_j + (\\alpha b)_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ijk}\\) Traditional linear regression \\(y_{ijk} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 \\text{song}_i + \\beta_2\\text{hive}_j + \\beta_3\\text{song}_i\\text{hive}_j + \\epsilon_{ijk}\\) These are equivalent, just with different contrasts (how we set up our model matrix). \\(RSE^2\\) is \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the unexplained variation after fitting the most complicated model. 16.4.5.7.2 Main effects only model, on hive/song aggregated data (bee_agg_mod) In R Notation RSE lm(honey_g ~ song + hive, data = honey_agg) \\(y_{ij\\cdot} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + b_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\\) where \\(\\epsilon_{ij} = (\\alpha b)_{ij}+\\frac{1}{K}\\Sigma_{k=1}^n\\) Traditional linear regression \\(y_{ij\\cdot} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 \\text{song}_i + \\beta_3\\text{hive}_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\\) The \\(RSE^2\\) here is the unexplained variation in the average honey production after accounting for the main effects of song and hive. We will use it to help find \\(\\sigma_{\\alpha b}\\). 16.4.5.7.3 Intercept only model for hives averages (bee_hive_mod) In R Notation RSE lm(honey_g ~ 1, data = honey_agg) (note aggregated dataset) \\(y_{\\cdot j \\cdot} = \\mu + \\frac{1}{I}\\Sigma^I_{i = 1}\\alpha_i + \\epsilon_j\\) where: \\(\\epsilon_j = b_j + \\frac{1}{I}\\Sigma\\epsilon_j\\) Traditional linear regression \\(y_{\\cdot j\\cdot} = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_{j}\\) The \\(RSE^2\\) here is hive-to-hive variation in average honey output (without taking into account the interaction between hive and song). We will use it to help find \\(\\sigma_{b}\\). 16.4.6 Where to next? We’ve done pretty much everything we can while remaining in the ordinary least squares context, and even in the simplest examples, all the aggregating and model fitting we’re doing will get a little tedious. Now we will turn to fitting linear mixed models more in more sophisticated ways with a specialist package. The models we’ll be fitting will rely on maximum likelihood methods. 16.4.7 Credits The commentary for this activity draws heavily on section 2.1 of Wood, S.

There are 3 males and 3 females. Each subject is asked to respond to 14 hypothetical situations. 7 of these situations are formal situations that usually require politeness (e.g., giving an excuse for being late to your scary boss), and 7 were more informal situations (e.g., explaining to a friend why you are late). For each hypothetical situation you measure the subjects voice pitch as they respond. You also take note of each of your subjects’ sex, since you know that’s another important influence on voice pitch. Note: Much of the content here is adapted from Winter, B. (2013). Linear models and linear mixed effects models in R with linguistic applications. arXiv:1308.5499. The language considered was Korean. Photos from unsplash.com 16.5.3 Read in the data and explore it For convenience, I have created a new variable called condition, it is just a modification of the attitude variable, that takes the level formal if the particular measurement was under formal conditions and informal if the measurement was under informal conditions. This variable contains the same information as the attitude variable, just coded how I want it to be, so I remove the attitude variable at the end. glimpse(polite_data, width=85) ## Rows: 84 ## Columns: 7 ## $ subject &lt;chr&gt; &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;,… ## $ gender &lt;chr&gt; &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, … ## $ scenario &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4,… ## $ attitude &lt;chr&gt; &quot;pol&quot;, &quot;inf&quot;, &quot;pol&quot;, &quot;inf&quot;, &quot;pol&quot;, &quot;inf&quot;, &quot;pol&quot;, &quot;inf&quot;, &quot;pol&quot;, &quot;i… ## $ frequency &lt;dbl&gt; 213.3, 204.5, 285.1, 259.7, 203.9, 286.9, 250.8, 276.8, 231.9, 25… ## $ condition &lt;fct&gt; formal, informal, formal, informal, formal, informal, formal, inf… ## $ sex &lt;fct&gt; F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F,… head(polite_data) ## # A tibble: 6 × 7 ## subject gender scenario attitude frequency condition sex ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 F1 F 1 pol 213. formal F ## 2 F1 F 1 inf 204. informal F ## 3 F1 F 2 pol 285. formal F ## 4 F1 F 2 inf 260. informal F ## 5 F1 F 3 pol 204. formal F ## 6 F1 F 3 inf 287. informal F Without doing any analysis, how might this data violate our assumptions for a linear model? 16.5.4 Recall: Linear regression assumptions Errors are independent (observations are independent) Errors are identically distributed and the expected value of the errors is zero, \\(E[\\epsilon_i]=0\\) Constant variance (homoscedasticity), \\(var[\\epsilon_i] = \\sigma^2\\). A straight-line relationship exists between the errors \\(\\epsilon_i\\) and responses \\(y_i\\) 1.-3. are usually expressed as assuming the errors are i.i.d normally distributed with mean of zero and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), \\[\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\] 16.5.4.1 Why we can’t assume independence Each subject has 14 measurements of their pitch (measured as the frequency of the vibration of your vocal cords) in different scenarios and different levels of politeness (formal/informal). With this kind of data, since each subject gave multiple responses (a “repeated measures” design), we can see that this would violate the independence assumption that’s important in linear modelling: multiple responses from the same subject cannot be regarded as independent from each other. In this scenario, every person has a slightly different voice pitch. This personal factor affects all responses from the same subject, thus responses are inter-dependent (correlated) within subjects rather than independent. I.e., if you have a generally low voice, even if you change your pitch when you are being informal versus formal, you probably still have a generally low pitch. There also differences, on average in pitch by sex, so this is something we will also want to account for in our model, later. So what do we do? 16.5.4.2 Let’s start with a picture Female subjects have an ID starting with “F” and males subjects have an ID starting with “M.” What do you see? polite_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = frequency, color=subject)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~subject, nrow = 2) + ggtitle(label=&quot;Voice pitch by subjects and formal/informal setting&quot;) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) # remove legend because we have facet names 16.5.4.2.1 Key themes from our plot Males tend to have lower voices than females. Within the male and the female groups, there is plenty of individual variation. Some subjects have relatively high pitch for their sex and others have relatively low values, regardless of the formal/informal version of the scenario. Subjects seem to generally use a higher pitch when speaking informally than they do when speaking formally. Before we can go further with this case study, let’s establish a few things… 16.6 Linear mixed models 16.6.1 Thoughts on plots for hierarchical/correlated data generally Make use of faceted plots! You may have also seen these called lattice plots or trellis plots. These plots show you relationships in your data, conditioned on one or more of your other variables. Facet based on your grouping units. When working with ggplot you can facet by adding the facet_wrap command. You can control which variables you condition on and how many rows and columns the facets are organised into. (There are lots of other great features we won’t go in to in depth here.) E.g. plot + facet_wrap(~one_var) or plot + facet_wrap(~one_var + two var, nrow = 3) Assume plot is a ggplot object. These names come from the appearance of these plots being similar to the lattice of a garden trellis. They also show you different faces (facets) of your data.] 16.6.2 Assumptions Linear mixed models assume that: There is a continuous response variable. We have modelled the dependency structure correctly (i.e. made correct choices about our random variables). Our units/subjects are independent, even through observations within each subject are taken not to to be. Both the random effects and within-unit residual errors follow normal distributions. The random effects errors and within-unit residual errors have constant variance . While it is possible to some extent to check these assumptions through various diagnostics, a natural concern is that if one or more assumptions do not hold, our inferences may be invalid. Fortunately it turns out that linear mixed models are robust to violations of some of their assumptions. 16.6.3 Our model set up 16.6.3.1 Our STA302 linear model \\[\\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{X\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\sim N(0, \\Lambda_\\theta)\\] 16.6.3.2 Linear mixed model \\[\\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{X\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{Zb} + \\epsilon\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{b} \\sim N(0, \\psi_\\theta),\\ \\ \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\sim N(0, \\Lambda_\\theta)\\] \\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\) is vector of outcomes for subject \\(i\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{Z}\\) are model matrices for the fixed and random effects, respectively, the vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) describes the effect of covariates on the mean/expectation of the outcome, \\(b\\) is the random effects for the units (assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero), \\(\\epsilon\\) is the residual errors, normally distributed with a given variance and the errors within units are mutually independent. In this course we won’t deal with more complicated situations than a simple error vector that is distributed \\(N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). 16.6.3.3 Alternative formulations Where you have observations \\(Y_{ij}\\) for repeated measures \\(j\\) on individuals \\(i\\), you may also see: \\[Y_{ij} = \\boldsymbol{X_{ij}\\beta} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\] Where \\(\\epsilon_{ij} = U_i + Z_{ij}\\) and \\(Z_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\tau^2)\\). These errors are normally distributed BUT correlated. OR \\[Y_{ij}|U_i \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\tau^2)\\] \\[\\mu_{ij{ = \\boldsymbol{X_{ij}\\beta}+U_i}}\\] \\[ [U_1,\\ldots,U_M]^T \\sim MVN(\\boldsymbol0, \\Sigma)\\] fixed effects: \\(\\boldsymbol{X_{ij}\\beta}\\) (what you’re used to) random effects: \\(U_i\\) for i in 1 to M (new part that makes this a linear mixed model) 16.6.4 What can correlated errors look like? 16.6.4.1 Random intercepts This is one example of dependence. Here, if a subject is above average in one observation, they’re likely to be above average in their other observations. 16.6.4.2 Random slopes In this case, not only would the residuals for subject 1 tend to be positive while the residuals for subject 2 would tend to be negative, the difference would get bigger as x increases. You don’t want that kind of pattern in the residuals! 16.6.4.3 Random slopes and intercepts Subjects appear to have different slopes AND intercepts. 16.6.5 How do we tell R which situation we’re in? We’ll be using the lmer() function from the lme4 package. Many R packages provide a “vignette” to help you understand how to use the package and the theory behind it. # This line only installs lme4 if you haven&#39;t got it installed already if(!(&quot;lme4&quot; %in% installed.packages())) install.packages(&quot;lme4&quot;) install.packages(&quot;lme4&quot;) vignette(&quot;lmer&quot;) 16.6.5.1 Vignette activity Have you ever looked at a package vignette before? Use the vignette for this package (see the code above) to try to fill out the syntax for the following situations. You may find Table 2 on page 7 of the vignette quite helpful. 16.6.6 Additional considerations 16.6.6.1 Linear mixed models come with lots of different names 16.6.6.2 Fixed vs. random effects Fixed effects are the things you care about and want to estimate. You likely chose the factor levels for a specific reason or measured the variable because you are interested in the relationship it has to your response variable. Random effects can be variables that were opportunistically measured whose variation needs to be accounted for but that you are not necessarily interested in (e.g. spatial block in a large experiment). The levels of the random effect are likely a random subset of all possible levels (although as a rule of thumb, there should usually be at least 5). However, if the experimental design includes nesting or non-independence of any kind, this needs to be accounted for to avoid pseudoreplication. 16.6.6.3 REML or ML The math behind maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) is beyond what I will assess you on in this course. The main difference between the two is how they estimate the variance parameters. They will estimate \\(\\beta\\)s the same way. REML is effectively a two-stage approach where estimates of the random effects are conditioned on the fixed effects. REML accounts for the degrees of freedom lost when estimating the fixed effects and provides us with unbiased estimates of our variance components. ML estimates of the variance components tend to be biased downward (smaller than they should be), making us more likely to pick models with simpler random effects structures than we should. We prefer ML if we need to compare two nested models based on their fixed effects, as we can’t do likelihood ratio tests with models fit with REML unless the fixed effects are exactly the same. We prefer REML when there is a large number of parameters or if our main goal is estimates of our model parameters (random and fixed). Which is usually our goal. For this course, we’ll usually use REML, unless we are trying to compare nested models with the same random effects. There are often not major differences between the two methods, anyways. 16.6.6.4 Confidence intervals and tests You can create Wald confidence intervals for fixed effects the way you’re used to from STA302. BUT for our random effects things can get a bit more awkward. A variance must be in \\([0, \\infty)\\), so what happens if you get an estimate for \\(\\hat{\\sigma_b^2}\\) that is \\(0.02 \\pm 0.04 = (-0.02, 0.06)\\)? We can get into trouble if our variance components are close to the boundary of the parameter space or if a test requires us to fix them at these boundaries. Despite these difficulties, if our interval estimates of our variance components are pretty safely away from 0, then we can conclude the associated random effect is needed in the model. If it seems that a variance component is effectively 0, than we can conclude we don’t need the associated random effect. We can also get this from likelihood ratio tests, where big or small p-values lead to clear-cut conclusions, but we face more challenges for making inferences when our p-value is close to our decision criteria. 16.7 Vocal pitch case study: Part 2 Recall: \\[Y_{ij} = \\boldsymbol{X_{ij}\\beta} + Z_{i}\\boldsymbol{b} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\] \\(Y_{ij}\\) is the vocal pitch for the \\(i\\)th subject on the \\(j\\)th vocal response. \\(X_{ij}\\beta\\) has an intercept and an effect for sex and condition (formal/informal) \\(Z_ib\\) represents subject \\(i\\)’s ‘baseline’ pitch \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is random noise (and potentially other unmeasured confounders) 16.7.1 Modelling individual means with random intercepts We can consider each subject’s mean vocal pitch and in our model we will assume different random intercepts for each subject. The mixed model estimates these intercepts for us. We are going to use the package lme4 and the function lmer() and then fit a model with only the random effect of subject (each subject gets their own intercept). 16.7.1.1 Random intercept only model # install.packages(&quot;lme4&quot;) library(lme4) # load the package sub_only = lmer(frequency ~ (1 | subject), data = polite_data) summary(sub_only) ## Linear mixed model fit by REML [&#39;lmerMod&#39;] ## Formula: frequency ~ (1 | subject) ## Data: polite_data ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 828.7 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.4980 -0.6071 -0.1817 0.6433 2.7520 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ## subject (Intercept) 4003 63.27 ## Residual 940 30.66 ## Number of obs: 84, groups: subject, 6 ## ## Fixed effects: ## Estimate Std. Error t value ## (Intercept) 192.66 26.04 7.397 16.7.1.2 What does this model do? (1 | subject) is the R syntax for a random intercept. It asks that we assume there is a different intercept for each subject. The ‘1’ stands for the intercept and the term to the right of the ‘|’ should be a nominal or factor variable to be used for the random effect. You can think of this formula as telling your model that it should expect that there’s going to be multiple responses per subject, and these responses will depend on each subject’s baseline level. This effectively resolves the non-independence that stems from having multiple responses by the same subject. 16.7.1.3 Interpreting this output From top to bottom: The model was fit using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) - what is that? We’ll see soon. Then we are shown our formula again and the data this model was fit with. The next two parts we won’t use much: there is much deeper you could go on the fitting and convergence of these models, but that is not within our scope, and we expect to see the scaled residuals centered near to 0. The next part gives us the estimated variances for the random effects in the model. Recall the variances we calculated diretly in the Statdew Valley activity. Finally, we have the fixed effect portions of the model, with a separate intercept but nothing else yet because we haven’t added any fixed effects. 16.7.1.4 Adding our fixed effects We’re interested in the effects of a formal/informal scenario and sex on the pitch of the subject’s voice, so we’ll add these as fixed effects. Question of interest: What is the influence of formal vs informal condition on voice pitch in speakers of this language, while accounting for sex and variation within subjects? 16.7.1.5 Model with condition and sex ## Linear mixed model fit by REML [&#39;lmerMod&#39;] ## Formula: frequency ~ condition + sex + (1 | subject) ## Data: polite_data ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 795.8 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.3629 -0.5677 -0.2082 0.4615 3.2900 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ## subject (Intercept) 599.5 24.49 ## Residual 844.6 29.06 ## Number of obs: 84, groups: subject, 6 ## ## Fixed effects: ## Estimate Std.

Maybe these differences don’t actually mean anything in the context of the variability of our data. That is why we want to take a modelling approach. 16.7.1.7 Random slopes for condition Previously we assumed that the effect of formal/informal conditions were the same for all subjects (one coefficient for this variable). However, the effect of the condition might be different for different subjects; that is, there might be a condition and subject interaction. For example, it might be expected that some people are more polite in formal scenarios, others less. We need a random slope model, where subjects and items are not only allowed to have differing intercepts, but where they are also allowed to have different slopes for the effect of formality on pitch. Do you think the slopes are different for different subjects? Note: The following model generates that warning boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular because our random effects are very small. This is an indication that we may be overfitting. We are including a random effect that we might not need to…(which, spoilers! is what we’ll find out at the end of this secion using our model comparison). ## boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular ## Linear mixed model fit by REML [&#39;lmerMod&#39;] ## Formula: frequency ~ condition + sex + (1 + condition | subject) ## Data: polite_data ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 795.8 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.3537 -0.5822 -0.2209 0.4785 3.2847 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Your grandmother was a bit eccentric when it came to farm management. She swore that her bees produced more honey if she played them music in the morning. In fact, she even mentioned that she thought they particularly liked K-pop. She left you some data that she thinks proves this. While the sample size isn’t that large, you decide to take a look anyways. The data is called honey and records the honey produced each month for each of her 6 hives (in grams). Each hive listened to each of the song options (Dynamite by BTS, Adagio in B minor by Mozart and No music) for a month, three times. The order was randomized for each hive. It took 9 months to collect this data and the information your grandmother left you says honey production should have been fairly constant over this period and that all the hives experienced the same weather conditions, food access, etc. ## Rows: 54 ## Columns: 3 ## $ hive &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1,… ## $ song &lt;chr&gt; &quot;No music&quot;, &quot;No music&quot;, &quot;No music&quot;, &quot;No music&quot;, &quot;No music&quot;, &quot;N… ## $ honey_g &lt;dbl&gt; 196.56, 199.58, 200.71, 195.80, 199.58, 200.71, 226.80, 227.55… 16.8.1 Model formula I said the model formula would look like this: \\[y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + b_{j} + + (\\alpha b)_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ijk}\\] where \\(y_{ijk}\\) is the amount of honey produced (in grams) in the \\(k^{th}\\) month by the \\(j^{th}\\) hive while listening to song \\(i\\). Here, \\(\\mu\\) is the grand mean of honey production, \\(\\alpha_i\\) are the \\(I\\) fixed effects for song and \\(b_j\\) are the random effects for hive \\(j\\). \\((\\alpha b)_{ij}\\) are the \\(IJ\\) interaction terms for the interaction between the the hive and the song. What does this represent here? Well, maybe some hives respond to a certain song quite differently to other hives. \\((\\alpha b)_{ij}\\) is a random effect because any term involving a random effect must also be a random effect. \\((\\alpha b)_{ij} ~ \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\alpha b})\\), \\(b_k \\sim N(0, \\sigma_b^2)\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{ijk} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). All the random effects are mutually independent random variables. 16.8.2 How would we fit this with lmer? This is how we would fit a model with only a hive effect: This is how we would fit our full model, with a hive effect AND a hive and song interaction: 16.8.2.1 Do we need the interaction? ## Likelihood ratio test ## ## Model 1: honey_g ~ song + (1 | hive) + (1 | hive:song) ## Model 2: honey_g ~ song + (1 | hive) ## #Df LogLik Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq) ## 1 6 -175.66 ## 2 5 -211.25 -1 71.199 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Conclusion: We get a really small p-value, so we have strong evidence against the hypothesis that the simper model, with no song/hive interaction is as good as our full model. 16.9 More fixed vs random effects practice Consider the following two examples from Roback &amp; Legler (2021), section 7.10. Identify which variable is the response and which are the fixed effects and the random effects. Cockroaches! For a study of cockroach infestation, traps were set up in the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom in a random sample of 100 New York City apartments. The goal is to estimate cockroach infestation levels given tenant income and age of the building. Variables: room type, tenant income,apartment, building age, building, count of cockroaches Radon in Minnesota. Radon is a carcinogen – a naturally occurring radioactive gas whose decay products are also radioactive – known to cause lung cancer in high concentrations. The EPA sampled more than 80,000 homes across the U.S. Each house came from a randomly selected county and measurements were made on each level of each home. Uranium measurements at the county level were included to improve the radon estimates. Variables: radon measurement, home, level of home, uranium, county 16.9.1 Answers 16.9.1.1 Cockroaches response: count of cockroaches fixed effects: room type (kitchen, bathroom, bedroom), tenant income, building age random effects: apartment, building 16.9.1.2 Radon response: radon measurement fixed effects: level of home (e.g. upper or lower level), uranium (county level variable) random effects: home, county 16.10 Advice for polishing your writing The U of T writing advice site has some great short articles with tips about common writing mistakes and tips for improving your writing.

Your U of T login should work with all of them. The below PDF file provides an overview of how you’ll be interacting with each one. At the bottom of the page is an embedded slideshow introducing you to the JupyterHub. You can always access Piazza from the Navigation Menu on the left. Instructions for setting up your U of T Zoom are on the Zoom page and links are in the Navigation menu and on the home page. 19.1.1 Admin Logo Description Quercus will be used for timed assessments, some submissions and announcements. Synchronous classes and office hours will be hosted via Zoom. You MUST join using your U of T Zoom account to be admitted. Get your account: utoronto.zoom.us Microsoft Forms will be used for several important administrative forms. You will need to be signed in to your U of T account in the same browser to access these. Markus will be used for the submission of code and analysis documentation for several assessments. peerScholar will be used for the Create, Asses and Reflect phases of the module writing and peer review tasks. You can access the peerScholar links through the associated Quercus assessments. 19.2 Using RStudio with the JupyterHub We will be using R through RStudio to conduct analyses in this course. If you have a local installation of R you are welcome to continue using that, but, for this course, you do not need to have R and RStudio installed. Instead, assessments and activities will be shared through the U of T JupyterHub. This gives you access to RStudio in your browser through your U of T login on any internet-connected device. It means you don’t have to fight package installations and we can instead focus on the good stuff. Please read through the following slides, experiment with the example sharing link, make sure you know how to knit an Rmd to pdf + export the pdf, and practice navigating and moving files.

Please only attend one of these sessions if you are prepared to… Image description: Captain Picard (of the Starship Enterprise) in uniform, pointing forwards. Text reads: ENGAGE 19.3.1 To participate in these activities, you need: A U of T LICENSED Zoom account to access the call. Some troubleshooting tips in this announcement: Make sure your Zoom is licensed!. A reasonable internet connection. A working microphone. To be WILLING TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE. Please don’t ruin this for others who are interested in engaging in meaningful group problem-solving. There is no reason to come and lurk. These sessions are the activity and nothing else. You can easily get marks for your knowledge basket in SOOO many other ways AND I will make an asynchronous practice version available so you don’t miss out on practice. 19.3.2 Before the activity you should: Remember that you don’t have to participate in Team Up! activities, there are plenty of other ways to earn your knowledge basket marks. Only participate if you really are going to participate (see above). Check you can access Shiny interactives on the JupyterHub: Module 1 interactive. If you get a ‘Not Found’ error this is most likely due to one of two issues: Solution 1: Ensure you don’t have any other interactives open. (Close any tabs with the orange-arcs JupyterHub logo). Solution 2: Go to https://jupyter.utoronto.ca, open a new RStudio session by going New -&gt; RStudio (see slide 3 of these instructions) and move any .Rmd files in your 🏠Home directory (see slide 10 of these instructions) to a new folder (or delete them if you don’t need them). Remember: No naked Rmds in YOUR home! Decide if you want to be randomized into a group or work with a group of people you already know in the course (section/tut enrolment doesn’t matter). If randomizing, join the Zoom link for the tutorial time you are attending. ‘Arrive’ on time as latecomers may not be placed in a group. If working with your own group, you don’t need to join the call (but can if you get stuck with the tech!). Decide at which time you want to do the activity and set up a personal Zoom/Teams/WeChat/Instagram/carrier pigeon/semaphore chat. Zoom has nothing to do with Team Up!. Read over the Team Up! instructions below. 19.3.3 Some rules/logistics Speak up! Practice talking about statistics. For these activities, I’d honestly rather you be wrong out loud than right in silence. Be kind and constructive. You are in a team, practice being a good team member. Team Up! does not have a great back end. If you don’t submit correctly or don’t join a group correctly, I CANNOT go in and check or move you around. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. No accommodations will be made for Team Up! issues. Team Up! marks will not be updated by hand (e.g., if you end up in a solo group/tech issues, etc.). You must do this as a group activity, during a tutorial time, if you wish to receive a knowledge basket grade. A ‘group’ is 2–4 people. All members of groups of 1 (solos) and 5+ will receive a zero. Group size is based on what is recorded by Team Up! through your registration with your group codes. You cannot do a Team Up! more than once. You cannot attend both sessions. If you have a ghost 👻in your room (randomized in the class organized Zoom call), please ‘Ask for help’ (there is a button). ‘Raise hand’ doesn’t alert me if you’re in a breakout room. Timing note: Assessment pages will become available at 15 minutes past the hour and remain available for 45 minutes. Ensure sure your team submits by the end of the session. 19.3.4 Team Up! Instructions Participating in Team Up! activities can earn you knowledge basket points. They will be based on how well your team does, so work together and give it a good effort. You will complete the following 5 steps: .midi[ 1. Introductions (first/personal name + a one-word description of how your week is going so far). Use this time to confirm everyone understands the instructions. 2. Driver sets up Team Up! group 3. Members join Team Up! group 4. Complete the activity 5. Submit the activity 19.3.4.1 Step 1: Decide on roles You will need: An Instructions Master who is responsible for helping the team follow these instructions carefully. A Screensharer who is responsible for sharing the activity on their screen. A Driver for the Team Up! side of the activity. The Driver acts as team leader, responsible for navigating the quiz, confirming the team’s final agreed upon answer to a question, and submitting the completed quiz score to Quercus.The Driver has a steering wheel next to their ID and is differently coloured than other Team Members. Team Members (other than the Driver) participate and choose vote on answers, so all team mates can see what they have chosen, but they cannot submit their choices to Team Up!. DECIDE THIS BEFORE CLICKING ANYTHING TO DO WITH TEAM UP! 19.3.4.2 Step 2: Driver sets up group The person in your group whose first/personal name comes last alphabetically will be the Leader (Driver) for the session. The Driver must do the below steps FIRST to get the group code. Then they will share the group code with all the members of the group so they can also join. 1 Log-in to Quercus from your device (phone, tablet, computer). 1 Click on the Team Up! assignment from the Course Overview page. 2 Click ‘Go to Tool.’ If it is not appearing, refresh your page or try a different browser. NON-DRIVERS! DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING! 3 Choose “Create New Group” 4 Share group ID in Zoom 19.3.4.3 Step 3: Members join Once the Driver has shared the group ID, AND ONLY THEN do the following: 1 Click on the Team Up! assignment from the Course Overview page. 2 Click ‘Go to Tool.’ If it is not appearing, refresh your page or try a different browser. 3 Input the code your driver provided and click ‘Join Group.’ 19.3.4.4 Step 4: Complete the activity You will need to have the interactive activity (question document) associated with this task open on to see the answer options and update any code. Be prepared to switch between Team Up! and the JupyterHub tab. The Driver chooses a question, and the team can participate by choosing their own answers and discussing their choices with each other. Once the team decides on a final answer, the driver chooses it and clicks the Check Answer button. Note: The Driver can check an answer despite what the team members choose, so be careful that you have consensus before clicking the Check Answer button. You cannot undo. If the answer is correct, you will be awarded the full score or “diamonds” for that question. You will be able to proceed onward by clicking the Next button that will appear under the Check Answer button or by clicking on a question in the menu on the left. If your team’s answer is not correct, discuss the question and choose again. Repeat until you get the correct answer. All teammates can see whether responses are correct/incorrect as well as their team’s overall score as they progress through the Team Up! session. 19.3.4.5 Step 5: The Driver MUST click Submit to Quercus for your answers to be processed. If this is not done, no one on the team will get a grade!!!! 19.4 Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom… Access to STA303 synchronous meetings and office hours is restricted to our students. Set up your U of T Zoom account 19.4.1 Make sure your Zoom is up to date To participate fully, you will need Desktop client or mobile app: version 5.3.0 or higher. You can check your desktop client or mobile app version by following these instructions. 19.4.2 Customize! Once you have logged in, please customize your profile: Update your name to your preferred name (what you would like us to call you in class) Note: this may not be allowed with your U of T settings, so don’t worry if this doesn’t work. Add a profile picture (please make it a photo of YOU or an avatar that looks like you…we don’t want Snoopy or Joe Biden15 in class) 19.4.3 VPN There is a University of Toronto VPN (UTORvpn) that you have access to as a student. It may help with video quality and access to U of T resources. If you are based in mainland China, the Alibaba Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN)Links to an external site. service should help with your Quercus access. 19.4.4 Notes: Please always use your real name and face for this course, and be cautious about changing them and your virtual background for other meetings. A joke background for a call with family or friends may not be appropriate for class. For class meetings, the settings will always be that your camera and microphone are off to begin with so you have the control to check these things first. We do ask that, when possible, you use your microphone in office hours, breakout groups and any other small group meetings and strongly prefer that you use your camera AND microphone. We trust you to make the best choice for your environment, comfort and learning. You may get a “This meeting is for authorized participants only message.” Choose the “Sign in with SSO” option to sign in. 19.4.5 Changing your profile picture on Zoom and Quercus Follow these instructions to add a profile picture (or bitmoji style avatar if you’d prefer) to Quercus and Zoom. I want this experience to be more social and less faceless. Please don’t use photos of cartoon characters, etc. A good photo will be a close-up of your face so we can see who you are even when the photo is small. 19.4.6 What to do if you experience technical difficulties during class? First, (if possible) send me a chat note that you’re having technical difficulties and are working to resolve them. Second, leave the meeting and re-enter. This often resets things and resolves the problem. Before entering the meeting, make sure all of your devices are properly plugged in and Bluetooth devices are connected. If that doesn’t fix things, exit the meeting again and update your Zoom Client. This is the Zoom software that should be on your computer. Here’s a short video tutorial explaining how to update the software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7zERcVLUBM. After updating, enter the meeting again to see if this resolved your problems. Our synchronous classes are recorded, so if your technology is just going catastrophically wrong, go get a cup of tea/coffee/water and relax, you can catch up with the recording when it is posted on Quercus. 19.4.7 What to do if your instructor or TA is experiencing technical difficulties on Zoom First, check the chat to see if the instructor or the project mentor have said what is going on and what they are doing to fix things and follow any instructions they give. Second, if they have disappeared completely, wait 10 minutes (or until the end of the meeting time, whichever comes first) before closing the call. (You can do other things in the meantime, but be ready to jump back in). Third, expect to see an announcement on Quercus afterwards telling you what to do (e.g. it might be to watch a video I’ll record later, to review some slides or perhaps there is nothing to do and i’ll see you next time). 19.5 Student support services and resources 19.5.1 Mental health support You may find yourself feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or anxious. Lots of people feel the same way. There is help available from mental health professionals 24 hours a day via online and phone-based services. Here are some that are available to U of T students: MySSP - My Student Support Program 1-844-451-9700, or outside of Canada call 001-416-380-6578 Good2Talk Student Helpline 1-866-925-5454, or text GOOD2TALK to 686868 Distress Centres of Greater Toronto 416-408-4357, or text 45645 There is also the new Navi tool for U of T students, it is a chatbot and your questions are totally anonymous. http://uoft.me/navi The student union are also curating a list here: https://www.utsu.ca/mental-health/ 19.5.2 General University resources The following are some important links to help you with academic and/or technical service and support: Health &amp; Wellness can help with appointments with a range of clinicians, nutrition, immunizations, sexual and reproductive health and much more. Many of their services continue to be available online. Arts &amp; Sciences student resources through Sidney Smith Commons Online General student services and resources at Student Life Tips for dealing with multi-choice questions (MCQs) Book an appointment with a learning strategist (they can help you with strategies for MCQs also) Full library service through the University of Toronto Libraries Resources on academic support from the Academic Success Centre Learner support at the Writing Centre Information about Accessibility Services Quercus Information in the Canvas Student Guide Logistical and social support for international students at the Center for International Experience Visit the A&amp;S online resources for students page for resources available to support you through your online studies. If you have further questions, please email ask.artsci@utoronto.ca. 19.5.3 Financial support A list of University financial supports, work-study opportunities, as well as provincial and federal government programs is available on the University’s Financial Support &amp; Funding Opportunity directory. 19.5.4 Arts &amp; Science COVID19 FAQ The Arts &amp; Science Undergraduate FAQ page addresses frequently asked questions that are specific to undergraduate students taking courses with the Faculty of Arts &amp; Science. On this page you will find information for: Messages from Dean Woodin can be found on the A&amp;S latest updates page. Yes, these are real images students have used.↩︎ "],["faqs-and-errata.html", "20 FAQs and Errata 20.1 Frequently asked questions 20.2 Other 20.3 Errata", " 20 FAQs and Errata 20.1 Frequently asked questions While Piazza is our main class question and answer board, this page will have some static Questions and Answers for frequently asked questions. Use Cmd + F (Mac) or Ctrl + F (PC) to search for keywords on this page. Additionally, make sure you’re familiar with the Syllabus. I’ve tried to explain as much as I could there. 20.1.1 Course admin 20.1.1.1 STA303 pre-requisites 20.1.1.1.1 I didn’t take STA302 or an equivalent course, can I still take STA303? No, sorry. We enforce pre-reqs strictly. This isn’t up to me. You will be removed from the course. Please reach out to the UG stats team (ug.statistics@utoronto.ca) about questions of this nature. Book an appointment during their office hours. For grad courses, please email grad.statistics@utoronto.ca. 20.1.1.2 Lecture and tutorial times 20.1.1.2.1 How exactly do the tutorials and lectures work? Wednesdays: 1st part is (recorded) content/demo and the second is office hour (unrecorded). Aiming for half-half, but will vary. Thursdays: The 1st Thursday of a module will have a Team Up! or other practice activity. This will also be made available asynchronously, but the knowledge basket points for a Team Up! can only be earned by synchronous, group participation. The 2nd Thursday will be drop-in TA office hours to get help on content and assessments. Thursday sessions are not recorded, but the Team Up! or other activities content will be made available to everyone. There are several other ways to earn your knowledge basket points if this doesn’t suit your tech setup (e.g. no mic) or time zone. 20.1.1.3 Recorded lectures 20.1.1.3.1 “Where can I find recorded lectures and how soon can I expect them to be available?” Recorded lectures will be linked on the Course overview page. I aim to have the links up within 24 hours of class. They take some time to process. 20.1.1.4 Sections 20.1.1.4.1 “Do L0101 and L0201 cover the same materials?” Yes. The only difference is when your synchronous class is. See the below question in “Attending synchronous class.” 20.1.1.5 Attending synchronous class 20.1.1.5.1 “Can I attend the synchronous class for the other section?” Yes!* *If the number of attendees is getting too close to the call cap of 300 (this is a Zoom license thing), preference will be given to those enrolled in the session and others will be asked to leave. Any Team Up! activity bonuses will also be applied—section/session does not matter. 20.1.1.5.2 “Why can’t I access the class/office hour Zoom meeting?” You must have and be signed in with your University of Toronto Zoom account. Use the ‘SSO’ (single sign-on) option. More info and troubleshooting advice here. 20.1.1.5.3 “Will STA303/STA1002 be able to be completed online-only?” Yes. STA303 will be a flipped course, with content delivered online and opportunities for activities both in-person (subject to health advice) and online. All assessments will be completed and submitted online. If you are enrolled in an in-person tutorial, you will have an option to attend online instead. Synchronous attendance is NOT required to pass this course, but being able to attend (online) synchronously at the times in the timetable may make things easier for you. 20.1.1.5.4 “Where is your office?”/“Can I come see you in-person?” At this stage, I cannot offer in-person office hours nor student meetings in my office. Drop-ins are not currently allowed for any instructors or TAs in Statistical Sciences, unless they have told you they have organized another meeting space for this purpose. 20.1.2 Assessments FAQ 20.1.2.1 Knowledge basket FAQ 20.1.2.1.1 “I don’t really understand the knowledge basket, how will that work? Can we earn more than 5 marks?” The knowledge basket maxes out at 5%, otherwise I get in trouble for giving away too many “free” points. (I know, I wish.) 20.1.2.1.2 “Can we do as many knowledge basket activities as we want in order to gain the full 5%?” Yes! But do try to plan ahead, as I won’t be adding a bunch of make-up opportunities at the end…part of the goal is to incentivize personalized, regular participation in the course to create the best learning outcomes for you. 20.1.2.1.3 “How fast will we receive grades back for the knowledge basket activities?” It will depend, but many should be fairly quick—a few days if autograded/based on completion. 1–2 weeks for professional development proposal and evidence &amp; reflection. 20.1.2.1.4 “I am not too sure what ‘pre-knowledge quiz: 80% or workshop’ is supposed to mean.” If you score 80% or more on the pre-knowledge check, you automatically get 0.5% for doing it + 0.5% for a high score. If you do the check but get less than 80% you get 0.5% for completion, and can still get that additional 0.5% if you come participate in the workshop. Workshop open to all. And you don’t have to go if you have other plan for filling your basket. It is meant to be helpful to you, though. And no, you can’t get the workshop AND 80%+ points. One or the other for a max of 1%. 20.1.2.1.5 “What will additional opportunities like speaker series reflections be like?” May vary depending on the speaker/workshop, but for next week (grad panel) it will likely be attendance + a short Quercus survey. Just confirming a few things still so, TBA. (Watch for more details in announcements.) 20.1.2.1.6 “Are the three phases of each writing assignment graded on completion?” Yes, but see caveats here in the general instructions for the writing tasks. 20.1.2.1.7 “No questions, although seems to be a hectic course with a lot of minor deadlines.” If you don’t want lots of little deadlines, you don’t have to have lots of little deadlines! Do the professional development tasks + a few Team Ups! or the professional development task + punctuation art. Throw in the pre-knowledge check and you’re looking great! 20.1.2.2 Portfolios FAQ 20.1.2.2.1 “I am curious about the format of portfolio and assessment and how they will be conducted.” 2022-01-12: More info over the next two weeks, but these will be a lot like a traditional assignment, but with a writing task (the module writing tasks are good indicators and practice) and some additional narrative about what you’re learning/demonstrating. You’ll submit commented code in an Rmd and the associated PDF. 20.1.2.3 Mixed assessments FAQ 20.1.2.3.1 “How does the mixed assessment work? Is it like a midterm?” Mostly, except there will also be a small amount of pre-work. More information closer too, but the overall goal is to make it more real-world. When you prep for a big meeting in the real world, you might calculate some summary stats, have a few basic plots ready, have some notes, etc. Sure, there are some things where you’ll have to think it through in the moment (in the mixed assessment and in the real world), but I hope having the untimed pre-work helps lessen some of the test anxiety folks can feel. Less mind reading, more targeted prep. 20.1.2.3.2 “What’s the difference between mini and mixed assessments? Are they both term tests?” One is bigger and one is smaller. ;) But yeah, the mini has one 50 minute timed component while the main mixed assessment will have more pre-work and two 50 minute timed parts. 20.1.2.3.3 Will we get some sample practice problems to work on before the mini-mixed and mixed assessments? The ‘mini’ is effectively practice problems for the main, but Team Up!s will also be useful practice for the mixed assessments. If there isn’t a Team Up! (which you’ve be able to review asynchronously for study purposes) for a module I’ll offer a practice quiz (no points) option or other practice activity. 20.1.2.3.4 “What exactly will we do in assessment weeks?” There is no new content or writing module. They are a time to focus your 6–8 hours of weekly STA303 time on the assessment. Mixed: doing the pre-work and the 100 minute (2 x 50) timed component. Project week: working with your group/self, asking questions in office hours. The expectation is that you’ll start the project well before then, but I know the end of the semester can be stressful and busy, so I’m making things as simple and focused for you as I can. 20.1.2.4 Final project FAQ 20.1.2.4.1 “What kind of activities will the final project entail?” More details before reading week, but you will receive data and a client brief and be asked to create a written report that includes an executive summary as well as a more technical report. 20.1.2.5 Assessments: General FAQ 20.1.2.5.1 “How we can choose path A or B for the marking scheme– would this be on Quercus?” As long as you’re okay with getting the higher of the two marks, I’ll calculate your grade both ways and give you the higher one. 20.1.2.5.2 “So are all assessment due on Thursday 3:03?” Almost all the big ones! The mixed assessments have a window, but professional development proposal, professional development evidence &amp; reflection, mini-portfolio, portfolio and project are all due on a Thursday at 3:03 p.m. 20.1.2.5.3 “Are we allowed to answer assignments with programming languages other than R?” This is an R-based course, so only coding assessments using R will be accepted. (Note: For the professional development task ONLY you could use another language in a blog post/write-up etc., as we are grading your goal-setting and reflection on a communication/collaboration task, not your code directly.) 20.1.2.5.4 “What are the minimum requirements to pass the course?” 50% overall, no special conditions. 20.1.3 Team Up! 20.1.3.1 Troubleshooting &amp; FAQ advice from U of T CTSI Link to student facing Quercus Support resources. 20.1.3.1.1 “My screen seems to be lagging compared to those of my group members (e.g., I’m not on the same question as the driver/members, the answer I chose does not appear on my group members’ screens, etc.)” As long as you are logged in, you will receive your grade, so just continue to participate by communicating with your team. Almost always, your device will re-sync with the rest of your team’s devices within a minute or two. If not, refresh your screen once. Repeatedly refreshing is not usually helpful! 20.1.3.1.2 “I’ve been disconnected. Will my quiz progress be saved? Can I re-join my group?” Enter the Team Up! session again and you will automatically be put back into your group. Your progress will be saved, and you will return to the question you or your group was working on. This is true for the Driver as well as any team member. 20.1.3.1.3 “How do I send my completed quiz results?” Click the large red “Submit to Quercus” button at the end of the Team Up! quiz. 20.1.3.1.4 “Can we change our group driver?” You can request a driver change by pressing the red exclamation mark in the top right of your Team Up! quiz. 20.1.3.1.5 “How is the driver for our group chosen, and how can the driver pass the group ID to others in remote classes?” Group members can decide who will be the Driver (ideally someone with a good internet connection). The Driver can pass the group ID to other members verbally through chat or microphone in breakout rooms. 20.1.3.1.6 “The Driver of my group has to leave unexpectedly or their device has stopped functioning. How do we proceed with the quiz?” Request for a Driver Change using the red button at the top right of your Team Up! Session. This button only provides help for Driver Changes. You may also need to speak with your instructor or TA. 20.2 Other 20.2.1 References 20.2.1.0.1 “Can you (Prof. Bolton) write me a reference?” Please read my personal policy here to get a sense of under what circumstances I could write for you, but basically, a good mark in one class is not sufficient and you need to have at least two ‘activities’ with me. If you believe you meet my basic criteria, you can request a reference from me here. I will then accept or decline based on the the information provided. 20.2.1.0.2 “Do you (Prof. Bolton) have any research opportunities available?” Research/work study/teaching assistant opportunities: See the Department website. The main round of TA recruitment occurs during the summer but there are occasionally emergency postings. Some information about opportunities with me on my website. Reading courses: STA496/497: Readings in Statistics must be registered for as part of special enrolment during July. I will not be taking on any further students. If you’re thinking about the future, I usually consider taking on a small number of STA497 students for a half-credit, year long version. There is much more information about my past students, research interests and what a course with me might be like on my website: https://www.lizabolton.com/reading_courses.html 20.3 Errata ID Location Note 1 Module 1 Team Up!

If the number of columns = the rank of the matrix all the columns are linearly independent. If the umber of columns is &gt; the rank of the matrix, all the columns are not linearly independent. You can only invert a square matrix if all its columns are linearly independent. (Determinant non-zero). Why do we care? In linear regression, to estimate \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\), our vector of coefficients, we calculate \\((\\boldsymbol X^T\\boldsymbol X)^{-1}\\boldsymbol X^T\\boldsymbol Y\\). The elements of \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\) can’t be estimated if \\(\\boldsymbol X^T\\boldsymbol X\\) (a square matrix) isn’t invertible. Clarification to what I said in the tests activity: We usually perform regression with an intercept because we don’t want to assume out line passes through the origin, 0. So, if there is an intercept, (column of 1s in the model matrix) we must convert every categorical variable with \\(k\\) levels into \\(k-1\\) dummy variables to have the intercept and still satisfies linear independence. IF we ditch the intercept, we can have k dummies, but this is only usually useful in the specific case of ANOVA. 21.2.2 Example ## # A tibble: 12 × 2 ## # Groups: species [3] ## body_mass_g species ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 3900 Adelie ## 2 3700 Adelie ## 3 3450 Adelie ## 4 3175 Adelie ## 5 4500 Chinstrap ## 6 3850 Chinstrap ## 7 3650 Chinstrap ## 8 4550 Chinstrap ## 9 5150 Gentoo ## 10 5000 Gentoo ## 11 5700 Gentoo ## 12 4600 Gentoo ## # A tibble: 12 × 4 ## body_mass_g species.Adelie species.Chinstrap species.Gentoo ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3900 1 0 0 ## 2 3700 1 0 0 ## 3 3450 1 0 0 ## 4 3175 1 0 0 ## 5 4500 0 1 0 ## 6 3850 0 1 0 ## 7 3650 0 1 0 ## 8 4550 0 1 0 ## 9 5150 0 0 1 ## 10 5000 0 0 1 ## 11 5700 0 0 1 ## 12 4600 0 0 1 21.2.2.1 Classic regression, k-1 dummies (intercept) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ species, data = pengwings) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -512.50 -310.94 -34.37 348.44 587.50 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

If you’re interested in knowing more, or just think matrix algebra is delicious, I think this is a delightfully approachable walk through. https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/132/ 21.3 p values (recap) Remember: “Small but mighty!” The smaller the p value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. We should never be making claims in in favour/against the alternative hypothesis. Our statistical claims are always about the null. This may inform practical decisions in less strict ways, depending on practical significance, risks, etc., but a correct statistical claim for a p value should ALWAYS be about the null. Absolutes are rare in teaching statistics. A common threshold for rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis is 0.05. This is mostly from habit/convention, rather than some truly meaningful cosmic value. “Yeah, 1 in 20? Unlikely, sure.” Difference disciplines/sub-disciplines develop norms appropriate to their context. Many statisticians—especially in light of the reproducibility crisis and poor public, and even sometimes researcher, understanding of p values—prefer to make statements about the strength of evidence, not just reject/fail to reject. p value range | Strength comment &gt; 0.1 No evidence against the null 0.05 &lt; p value &lt; 0.1 Weak evidence against the null hypothesis 0.01 &lt; p value &lt; 0.05 | Moderate/some evidence against the null hypothesis 0.001 &lt; p value &lt; 0.01 Strong evidence against the null hypothesis &lt; 0.001 Very strong evidence against the null hypothesis 21.3.1 What if you get a value that is exactly one of these thresholds? It would be very rare to get a p value of exactly one of these thresholds. If you were to, you could decide based on your judgment of the context. Should you be more or less conservative in your interpretation based on the needs of the project/client? So, you’ll almost always have something, that while it may round to 0.001 (or another threshold), is really something like 0.001345789 or 0.00098963. What judgment would you make in each case, with this in mind? But remember, these are fuzzy boundaries based on easy-to-grasp probabilities for humans, particularly humans used to thinking in base 10. 1 in 20, 1 in 100, 1 in 1000, etc. Easy to think about but not universally meaningful thresholds. Honestly, being a little over or under really doesn’t make that much of a difference. p values are continuous random variables. We impose discrete categories for our own ease. Used too rigidly, these guidelines have the same problem as rejecting/failing to reject, but just with a few more levels.

AS Note-taking Team 22.0.1 Looking for student representatives for STA303 Our course is part of a small pilot of student representative pilot for the Department of Statistical Sciences and I am looking for two undergraduate student representatives to work with me to represent our course. (STA1002 students, there isn’t a grad version of this, but you can also provide feedback to these reps and I encourage you to also reach out to me directly!) Student representatives work with their instructor to solicit and respond to student feedback throughout the semester. Representatives talk with their instructors about how the course is going, provide feedback to the department about student needs more generally and learn about department resources so that they can help connect students to these, as relevant. You can learn more about the experience from previous reps here. 22.0.1.1 The role of a student representative Once a rep is selected, they will: Attend a mandatory training session. Have their email made available to the class on Quercus so students can contact them. They may also introduce themselves in a synchronous class, or write a small blurb for an announcement or create a pre-recorded video. This is up to the student/instructor team. Reach out to students to elicit feedback. Additional tasks (e.g., helping with optional student pulse surveys or organising study groups or class events, etc.) would be left to the discretion of the student representative and instructor (they are not a required part of the program). Keep in regular contact with the instructor as issues or concerns arise. 22.0.1.2 Benefits of being a student representative Being part of creating a great learning experience for themselves and others. Networking with other students and members of the Department. Opportunities to work closely with an instructor that may mean they could be a strong referee for you and/or lead to taking a reading course with them etc. A chance to demonstrate and improve communication, leadership, and organisational skills. Something to put on a CV. 22.0.1.3 How to become a rep If you are eligible (see below), you can put yourself forward via this form. Please make sure you choose the correct section, where applicable! Student representatives for each section will be selected via lottery from the eligible students that have expressed interest by Monday, January 24 at 6:00 p.m. ET. 22.0.1.4 Eligibility criteria You will need to be available to attend an online training, 11:10 a.m.–12:00 p.m. ET on Friday, 28 January 2022.
