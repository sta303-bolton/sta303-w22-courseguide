## Learning checklist
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the structure and policies of STA303.  
- Be able to open and work with an RMarkdown document, knit to pdf and export that pdf (RStudio, JupyterHub).
- [STA302 review] Explain the assumptions of linear regression and identify situations where they might be violated.  
- Describe the execution and purpose of several common statistical tests (one-sample t-test, paired sample t-test, two-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA), and identify how to conduct them in a linear regression framework.  
- Create a reproducible example (reprex) for use in explaining an error being produced by your code.

## Instructor information

**Prof. Liza Bolton**

**Course email**: sta303@utoronto.ca

**Office hours**: During the second half of Wednesday classes: 11:10—12:00 p.m. ET and 4:10—5:00 p.m. ET

Please do not email my individual email with STA303 questions or use Quercus mail. It makes it harder to keep track of and address your questions. Sending me messages on three different platforms will NOT speed up my response. I will not respond messages that don't follow the course communication policy.

## Upward management tips

'Upward management' is basically managing your manager. ^[I used to haaaate this concept because I learned it while doing a consulting internship at a large international professional services firm and I really struggled with my manager.] If you make their life easier and help them be more effective, this should also make *your* life easier and is a good investment in your own career and skills building.

While our course isn't a business, some of the basic parts of this concept apply well to your time at university AND can set you up for success in graduate studies and your future career.

**But why should you put effort into upward managing me?** Well, while I will always seek to treat all students fairly and to listen to your feedback, YOU can make this easier or harder for me, and thus make this course better or worse for yourselves. 

For example, if I have to use all my time and energy following up on unclear emails for more information and dealing with students who haven't followed instructions etc. etc....I won't have that energy to put into writing TeamUp! activities to give you extra practice and opportunities to earn bonus points.


### Communicate using the tools your manager prefers  
* **In business**, this means knowing who likes face-to-face vs email, or whether your manager would rather receive an instant message than an email for a quick question.
* **In STA303**, this means: 
  - Using Piazza for all course admin and content questions.
  - Using the appropriate forms for accommodations and regrade requests.
  - Emailing **sta303@utoronto.ca** for private issues not otherwise covered by the other tools, e.g. emailing me your Accommodation Services letter, requesting an extension to an assessment that conflicts with essential travel.
  - Asking questions in office hours.
  

### Write good emails (when emails are appropriate)

- **In business**, this might mean:
  - Choosing who should be the main recipients vs CCed/BCCed. 
  - Ensuring your contact details are clear in your signature.
  - Make sure the subject line is informative and short
  - Making the text of the email as clear and concise as possible.
  - Use proper grammar and punctuation. 
  - Don't use emoji in formal emails. If in doubt, leave 'em out.

- **In STA303**, this looks like:
  - Everything in the right-hand column, plus the following.
  - Starting an email with "Hi Prof. Bolton," or "Hi Liza,".^["Dear Madam" and "To my esteemed professor" honestly make me uncomfortable.]
  - Sign off the email with your **preferred name** (i.e. what should I call you when I reply) and if your have different official name, include that and your UTORid below your name.
  - Subject line including [Prof. Bolton] or [TA name] if your email is for a specific person.


### Understand your manager's goals
- **In business**, this might look like understanding their KPIs and how you can help make sure these are met.
- **In STA303**, most of *my* goals are *for you*, like that you learn useful statistical skills, improve your writing skills etc. I also personally want to improve as an instructor and have fun talking about something I love. 
  - You can help me with these goals by working on this course every week, trying your best, asking for help early and often, engaging with feedback gathering mechanisms and providing constructive feedback if something is not working.

### Demonstrate self-management and resilience while also asking for help and flagging problems early. 

- **In business**, this might look like:
  - Being proactive about addressing possible problems before they occur. Managers like a 'no surprises' policy.
  - Preparing a list of questions to cover in a meeting or to compile in an organized fashion into one email (instead of ten). 
  - Searching for answers yourself before asking your manager and improving your strategies for finding available information.

- **In STA303**, this looks like:
  - Putting in a little effort into find answers before posting on Piazza/asking in class. (*Have you searched Piazza? have you re-read/watched the assigned materials? have your checked the syllabus and recent announcements?*)
  - Come to office hours often, lists of questions very welcome!
  - Getting in touch (or asking your registrar to) **early** if you might hate to miss a lot of class. It is usually easier to find a solution if I know things ahead of time, or as soon as possible after.


## Recap of linear models

### Why model?

- The goal of a model is to provide a (relatively) simple summary of a dataset.
- We can describe data AND make predictions.

### Linear models 

In a linear model, 

$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + ... + \beta_px_{pi} + \epsilon_i$  

The response is predicted by a linear function of
explanatory (or predictor) variables plus an error term.

a.k.a.

__DATA = MODEL + ERROR__


### Linear regression assumptions

**L**: your model is **L**inear.

**I**: Errors are **I**ndependent (usually satisfied if observations are independent).

**N**: Errors are **N**ormally distributed  with expected value zero, $E[\epsilon_i]=0$


**E**: **E**qual/constant variance (homoscedasticity), $\text{var}[\epsilon_i] = \sigma^2$.


We can express "I N E" above as assuming the errors are i.i.d Normal with mean of zero and variance $\sigma^2$, 
$$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

### What makes it a _linear_ model?

A model is **linear** if it is *linear in the parameters*. That is, all the $\beta$ enter the model in a linear way. It is totally fine if the predictor variables enter the model in a non-linear way.

#### Linear
- $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \beta_2x_i^2 + \epsilon_i$  
- $y_i = \beta_0 + γ_1δ_1x_{1i} + \beta_2\exp(x_{2i}) + \epsilon_i$

#### NOT linear
- $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i^{\beta_2} + \epsilon_i$  
- $y_i = \beta_0 exp(\beta_1x_{1i}) + \epsilon_i$

Internally screaming "DON'T LET THE BETAS TOUCH" often helps me remember what is not linear. Additionally, don't let them do anything _weird_, like get exponentiated.

## The data for module 1

The data we'll be looking for the next section of this week is from the `palmerpenguins` package by Allison Horst.

```{r}
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/m1/lter_penguins.png")
```

_Artwork by \@allison_horst_

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="20%"}

if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::asis_output("There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content.")
} else {
 knitr::include_graphics("images/m1/pengwings.gif")
}
```

### Let's meet the penguins 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

glimpse(penguins, width = 80) # width here just influences how this is displayed
```

The `glimpse` function comes from the `tibble` package, which is in loaded by the `tidyverse` package.

One of the most common issues students encounter when learning R is that they are trying to use functions that they haven't installed or loaded the package for. Make sure you've read the [slides about RStudio on the JupyerHub](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/204826/pages/course-tools#jupyter) because packages you install there will need to be **reinstalled each session** if they are not the list of automatically available ones. 
`tidyverse` is automatically available so you only need to run `library(tidyverse)` or use the namespace for the function `tibble::glimpse()`. 

### The variables

I hope most of the variables here are clear from their names. In particular, we will be interested in `species`, which has three levels (`r unique(penguins$species)`), `sex`  (`r unique(penguins$sex)`), `body_mass_g` (body mass in grams) and `flipper_length_mm` (length of their flippers measure in mm). We're not using the variables about the bills, but I thought this diagram was interesting anyway.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/m1/culmen_depth.png")
```
_Artwork by \@allison_horst_


```{r, echo=FALSE}
flipper_bill <- penguins %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sex)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                             y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = sex),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = species)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Flipper and bill length",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Bill length (mm)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Sex",
       caption = "Source: @allison_horst, palmerpenguins package") +
  theme(
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")
ggsave("images/m1/ah_plot.png", flipper_bill, width = 7, height = 5)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/m1/ah_plot.png")
```

Here are all our variables of interest in one plot.

Note: In  this chart and in future analyses involving `sex`, penguins with an unknown sex have been removed.

## Common statistical tests as linear regression

[There is an interactive version of the below notes at this link.](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsta303-bolton%2Fsta303-w22-activities&urlpath=shiny%2Fsta303-w22-activities%2Finst%2Ftutorials%2Fsta303_m1_tests%2F&branch=master)

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")

# TODO make these available again
#remotes::install_github("rstudio/learnr", force = TRUE)
#library(learnr)
#remotes::install_github("rstudio-education/gradethis")
#gradethis::gradethis_setup()

library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

# replace include=FALSE with include=TRUE (note lack of spaces) to create the version that has the answers in it
```

### Introduction

You have probably encountered several statistical tests in your studies so far. 

#### Parametric
**E.g. one-sample t-tests, paired t-tests, two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA**  
Parametric tests make assumptions about the distribution of the population from which our sample data have been drawn.

#### Non-parametric
**E.g. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallace**  
Non-parametric tests do not assume that our outcome is Normally distributed. They are sometimes called 'distribution-free', but note that this is because they have fewer assumptions than parametric tests, not because they have no assumptions at all.

#### Aside: But why are there two types of tests?

Parametric tests are more **powerful**, i.e., they have a better chance of detecting an effect if there is one there to find. So why would you ever use a less powerful test? Well, with great power comes ~~great responsibility~~ more assumptions that must be valid to proceed. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}

if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::asis_output("There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content. \\url{https://tenor.com/view/spider-man-uncle-ben-with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-its-true-just-saying-gif-24193883}")
} else {
 knitr::include_graphics("images/m1/uncleben.gif")
}

```

Non-parametric tests are a great choice when your outcome is an ordinal variable, is ranks, or there are problematic outliers. 

For the purposes of this lesson, we're going to focus more on parametric tests, but also take a look at the corresponding non-parametric tests with the slight white lie that they are just ranked versions of their parametric companions. This approach is pretty good as long as you have a reasonable sample size.


_Imagine this:_   
_You're on a ship trying to spot land. **Parametric** tests are the crew member with the best eyesight, but they can be fussy and the conditions have to be right for them to work in or they will breakdown._

_**Non-parametric** tests are the crew member with not quite as good eyesight, but they're more laid back about the conditions you make them work in._

In the following sections we'll explore several of these tests.

### One-sample t-test

I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

#### Use case

You want to know if it is believable that the population mean is a certain value (our 'hypothesized value' below).

#### Assumptions
1. The data are continuous.
2. The data are normally distributed.
3. The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample

(Do these sound familiar from linear regression?)

#### Hypotheses
$$H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}$$
$$H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}$$

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population mean is some hypothesized value.

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

$$ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{hypothesized val}}{s/\sqrt{n}} $$

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom df = n - 1 and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.


#### Example

Suppose existing research suggests that the average weight of penguins is 4000 grams. You want to see if this makes sense for your new penguins data.

$$H_0: \mu = 4000$$
$$H_1: \mu \ne 4000$$

The `penguins` dataset is already loaded, you you don't have to run any libraries. Use the `t.test()` function run a one-sample t-test.



```{r onesamplt, echo=T}
t.test(penguins$body_mass_g, mu = 4000, var.equal = TRUE)
```


#### Now as a linear model

First, consider the following, what would a linear regression with no predictor variables and just an intercept tell you?

Create a linear regression model called `mod1`(replace the blank below) that is an 'intercept only model' with `body_mass_g` as the response.

```{r onesamptlin-check, echo=T}
mod1 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ 1, data=penguins)
summary(mod1)
```

It turns out the estimate from this linear regression is the same as the sample mean. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, echo=T}
mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE) #na.rm = TRUE removes missing values
```

Now, recall that with the t-test, we calculate our test statistic by subtracting the hypothesized value from the mean. Let's run the linear model again, but on the left-hand side of the formula, subtract the hypothesized value.


```{r onesamptlin2, echo=T}
mod2 <- lm(body_mass_g-4000 ~ 1, data=penguins)
summary(mod2)
```


Compare the results of this `summary(mod2)` and your earlier t-test. You should see that the t value, degrees of freedom and p-value are the same for both analyses.

Thus, our one sample t-test hypotheses,
$$H_0: \mu = \text{hypothesized val}$$
$$H_1: \mu \ne \text{hypothesized val}$$

are equivalent to our linear regression hypotheses about the intercept,

$$H_0: \beta_0 = \text{hypothesized val}$$
$$H_1: \beta_0 \ne \text{hypothesized val}.$$

#### Wilcoxon signed-rank test

While the linear regression approach to the one-sample t-test is exact, we can also approximate the Wilcoxon rank-sign test with linear regression. See below. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/m1/wilcoxon.png")
```

Note: The above is just example from some toy data, but aims to illustrate how a t-test is treating the data and how the Wilcoxon test is treating the data. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Function to get signed rank of each observation  
signed_rank = function(x) sign(x) * rank(abs(x))

# The wilcoxon test function 
wilcox.test(penguins$body_mass_g, mu = 4000)

# Equivalent linear model
mod3 <- lm(signed_rank(penguins$body_mass_g-4000) ~ 1)
summary(mod3)
```

[Optional] Check out the theory behind the rank transformation in section 3.0.2 https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/#3_pearson_and_spearman_correlation

#### Paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon matched pair

A paired t-test is equivalent to a one sample t-test if you just consider $x_{\text{diff}\ i} = x_{1i} - x_{2i}$, i.e., $x_{\text{diff}\ i}$ is the difference of the paired values for each observation, and proceed with $x_{\text{diff}\ i}$ as you would in the one sample case. Likewise for the Wilcoxon. 

The R code (not evaluated here) would be as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Built-in Wilcoxon matched pairs
wilcox.test(x1, x2, paired = TRUE)

# Equivalent linear model:
summary(lm(signed_rank(x1 - x2) ~ 1))
```

### Dummy variables

Let's take a quick detour before we explore the next tests. We'll need to understand the concept of dummy variables and contrasts first.

#### The matrices we use for linear regression

Recall that we can express our linear regression in matrix form: 
  
  $$\mathbf{y} = X\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon$$
  
  where

$$
  \mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} 
y_1 \\\ 
y_2 \\\ 
\vdots \\\ 
y_n 
\end{pmatrix} ,
$$
$$
  \boldsymbol\beta = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_0  \\\ \beta_1  \\\ \beta_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \beta_p \end{pmatrix}, \quad
\boldsymbol\varepsilon = \begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon_1  \\\ \varepsilon_2  \\\ \vdots  \\\ \varepsilon_n \end{pmatrix}
$$
  
  and 

$$X = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_1 \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{x}^\mathsf{T}_n \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 1 &  x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
1 & x_{21} & \cdots & x_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}
\end{pmatrix}$$
  
  We often talk about **X** as the **model matrix**  (or design or regressor matrix) and it will be the focus of this section.

#### Getting our model matrix in R

Let's start by fitting a model with `body_mass_g` as the response and `flipper_length_mm` and `species` as the predictor variables.

(Note: Users of statistics use a lot of different words to refer to the same thing. Can you think of other terms people might use instead of _response_ and _predictor_?)

```{r modmat1, echo=T}
mod4 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species, data=penguins)
summary(mod4)
```

Now we can use the `model.matrix()` function to extract the model matrix for `mod4`. I've applied `head()` to stop the entire thing being printed.


```{r modmat2, echo=T}
head(model.matrix(mod4), n = 20)
```


You'll notice that even though we only had an intercept and two variables, we have four columns in our model matrix. You should also notice that R has given the columns helpful names, and that we have a column for the Chinstrap species and the Gentoo species, but not the Adelie species.

Further, recall that when we are working with a categorical variables we call the different values the the variables can take **"levels"**. I may also refer to these as factor variables, and talk about the "levels of the factor". 

What R is doing is dropping the first level (alphabetically) of the categorical variable and then creating **dummy variables** for each of the other levels.

The dropped level becomes our **reference level** and this should be familiar from interpreting summary output in previous courses where you have conducted multiple linear regressions with categorical variables. 

A dummy variable is also called an indicator variable, and it *indicates* whether or not the given observation takes that level or not. I.e., if the 40th penguin in this dataset had a 1 in the speciesGentoo column, then I know it is a Gentoo penguin, and that it won't have a 1 in the speciesChinstrap column because each penguin can only have one species.

More generally, the sum across the row of the dummy variables for one categorical variable will either be 0 (if that observation has the reference level) or 1 (not the reference level) but you will never have more than one 'one' amongst the dummies for a given categorical variable.

###### [Unassessed aside] Why do we have to drop one of the levels?

You may recall that for the matrix calculations required to get our vector of $\beta$s, we need to be able to invert X our matrix. We can only invert matrices for which all the columns are linearly independent and if we have the intercept AND dummies for all the levels of the categorical variable, our matrix will be linearly dependent.

Additional optional discussion [here](#matrices).

### Two means 

Back to tests!

Independent t-tests let you compare two means. I am assuming you've seen this in a 200-level statistics course or equivalent. Brief recap below.

#### Use case

You want to know if it is believable that two independent groups have the same population mean.

#### Assumptions

1. The data are continuous.
2. The data are normally distributed (in each group).
3. Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
4. The variances for the groups are equal. 

Notice that these are the same assumptions as the one-sample t-test, but with the equality of variances assumption added.

#### Hypotheses

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$$
$$H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$$

What are we doing? Finding the strength of evidence against the claim that the population means for both groups are the same. This differs from the one sample test because we have uncertainty about BOTH values here. Both are population parameters that we don't know. 

The test statistic, t, is calculated as follows:

$$ t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{s^2(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} $$

We then compare this t value to the t-distribution with degrees of freedom $df = n_1 + n_2 - 2$ and find the area under the curve that represents the probability of values likes ours or more extreme.


#### Example

Conduct an independent t-test to test if the mean of `body_mass_g` is the same for male and female penguins (`sex`). Add your code below. Note: you must set `, var.equal = TRUE` as one of the arguments for it two be the independent t-test. If you don't set this we are conducting a *Welch's t-test*. I won't be covering this, but it is covered in the source credited at the end of this activity.


```{r twosamp, echo=T}
t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins, var.equal = TRUE)
```


Now, based on what we've learned, write a linear model using the `lm()` function to do the same this as our independent t-test. Save the model as `mod5`.

```{r twosamplin, echo=T}
mod5 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins)
summary(mod5)
```


Take a moment to match up parts of the outputs that are the same. There is a difference here in that the sign of the test statistics differs. That does not matter as out t-distribution is symmetrical and we're doing a two-tailed test. 


#### Mann-Whitney U
Similar idea to before, except for this test it is just rank not signed rank.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Wilcoxon / Mann-Whitney U (multiple names)
wilcox.test(body_mass_g ~ sex, data = penguins)

# As linear model with our dummy-coded group_y2:
summary(lm(rank(body_mass_g) ~ sex, data = penguins))
```

### ANOVA

#### Use case

You've probably seen 'ANOVA' in the context of model comparison, but it is also a popular test in psychology and other disciplines. 

Let's look specifically at one-way ANOVA (or the F-test). It tests if all the means for several groups (more than 2) are the same or if at least one is different. 

I hope this sounds a bit like the next evolution from the independent t-test...

(+ 1000 stats respect points to anyone who draws Pokemon-esque evolutions of these three tests...with regression as the mega-evolution...)

#### Assumptions

And it just so happens that the assumptions for the one-way ANOVA (also called the F-test) are EXACTLY the same as for the independent t-test.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}

if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::asis_output("There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content. \\url{https://gifst.blogspot.com/2019/03/snl-hi-saturday-night-live-hey-kate.html}")
} else {
 knitr::include_graphics("images/m1/meagain.gif")
}
```


1. The data are continuous.
2. The data are normally distributed (in each group).
3. Each group is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected in the sample
4. The variances for the groups are equal. 

#### Hypotheses

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_k $$

$$H_1: \text{at least one }\mu \text{ differs from the others} $$

#### Example

Let's now look at body mass across species. Suppose we wanted to know if was believable that the the means body mass in grams was the same across all three species. This is when we could fit a quick ANOVA to test this. The `aov()` allows us to do this.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
summary(aov(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins))
```

That looks a lot like the output from calling summary on `lm()`...in fact, aov is just a wrapper for lm! Which means it has been linear regression the whole time.

## Reproducible examples (reprex)

### What is a reproducible example?

Well, it is an example that someone else can reproduce...

Specifically, it is a minimal example needed for someone helping you to reproduce an error or other behaviour you would like to show them with. 

This is especially helpful while we are all working online! I can't look over your shoulder in a lab to see what's wrong. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}

if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::asis_output("There is a GIF in the web version. Not required content.")
} else {
 knitr::include_graphics("images/m1/throwcomp.gif")
}
```

### Why should you care about creating reproducible examples?

- Useful professional skill for those working with R and other programming languages in graduate school/future employment (concepts transferable to programming in any language).
- The best way to help me (and the TAs and your classmates) help YOU on Piazza.
- The process of preparing a reprex to ask for help forces you to think about your code in a specific way that can help you spot the problem without actually having to ask anyone else (this literally happened to me about 2 hours before writing this slide!)


#### Other things to know

- Please try to use use reprexes when asking for help on Piazza!
  - The outputs from the reprex package work beautifully on Piazza, too. 
  - No more upside down photos of computer screens taken from phones, please! 
- `reprex` is installed in the JupyterHub and will be loaded whenever we run `library(tidyverse)`
- You won't have to worry about the data side of reprexes as much for this course, as in almost all cases we will all be working with the same data. But! It is a key skill if you will be working with data and programming languages in the future.

### Watch the creator of the reprex package explain it

Jenny Bryan is a hero of mine, and this was even BEFORE I knew she was the creator of the `reprex` package.

I think the whole video is excellent, and you're very welcome to watch all of it, but at minimum, please watch the following time intervals:

- 0:00 - 7:20 (background and initial demo)
- 14:08 - 29:48 (philosophy and examples)

**The video and slides are on this page: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/learn-reprex.html**

### Using reprexes on Piazza

[Watch this 4 minute video.](https://play.library.utoronto.ca/f395cfcc26b4009cbc28c1aa9a86096c)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="60%"}

if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics("images/stop-video.png")
} 
```

Web version embedding for MyMedia is not great, I would recommending opening the link and/or going full screen.

## Reading strategy: previewing and skimming {#previewskim}

In graduate school and/or in future employment, it is likely that you will need gather and synthesize information from a range of written sources. To decide if a source is useful to you, and to be as efficient and effective as possible, it is important to have strategies for approaching reading. 

In the next module, for the knowledge basket writing task, you will be guided through reading an article called Science isn't broken and asked to respond to it. You can also keep this in mind as a stategry for 'first reads' of course notes, or when re-reading to find some.

__Previewing__ a written text helps you think about the origins and purpose of the text, how it is organised, and where you expect to find information.

__Skimming__ is done after previewing, and is a strategy of reading key paragraphs, like the first and last which usually introduce and conclude the piece, as well as reading the opening sentences of in-between paragraphs and paying attention to figures, captions and any other emphasized text.

## Getting ahead on Module 2

Students who are unfamiliar with the `tidyverse`, especially `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, may find Module 2 to be quite full on. You may wish to start the readings for the next module early in this case.
