# How to use this course guide

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quercus-cover.png")
```

This course guide has been created in R using the [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/) package.

In the web version, you can put this guide into dark mode and change the font style, if you find a different display preferable. Play around with the buttons at the top of the screen and see what they do.

You can download a PDF version of the whole guide with the download button (on the web version, look for the PDF icon button at the top). Note that *many* parts of this guide will be updated as the course proceeds, so the PDF might not be that useful to you unless you are separating out relevant portions for your annotations/notes, etc. Alternatively, to get just a specific chapter, you can 'Print to PDF' from your browser, and this is also how you can get a PDF copy of any linked/embedded slides. Shortcut: Cmd+P or Ctrl+P, and select 'Save as PDF' (or similar).
