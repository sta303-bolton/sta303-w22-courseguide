Image source: <https://www.nsta.org/q-if-tree-falls-forest-and-theres-no-one-around-hear-it-does-it-make-sound>

If a tree falls in a forest, and there's no one around to hear it, does it make a sound? Or, more relevant to this course, if you do a data analysis and can't share it with anyone in helpful ways, did you*really* do anything? With this in mind, you will have the opportunity to choose an area of relevant professional development to pursue over the course of the semester. This could include technical skills that make you better at collaborating with others (version control, Git, GitHub), creating things others will find useful (an R package) or practising communication (oral or written).

There is a 1% **proposal** due fairly early in the semester, and then the final submission of **evidence** of, and **reflection** on, your activity is worth 3% and due toward the end of the semster.

Example professional development tasks include:

-   Learning how to set up and use Git and GitHub (this might come in handy if collaborating on the final project with a group)

-   Setting up a personal profile website (a bit like a digital CV, GitHub provides free hosting for simple sites)

-   Participating in weekly TidyTuesday activities

-   Writing a stats blog

-   Developing an R package and sharing it on GitHub

-   A public speaking based activity like a debating society or Toastmasters

-   Conducting a series of interviews with industry professional or academics and publishing videos/write-ups

-   Create a wildly successful stats memes TikTok à la [Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti](https://www.tiktok.com/@chelseaparlettpelleriti/video/6811647290709757189?u_code=d894729j1bcal8&preview_pb=0&language=en&timestamp=1585960235&user_id=6736543492652696582&utm_campaign=client_share&app=musically&utm_medium=ios&user_id=6736543492652696582&tt_from=twitter&utm_source=twitter&source=h5_m) (okay, maybe not this one...but she's well worth checking out)

Note: the task must be related to **communication or collaboration in some way**. For example, 'learning SQL' would not be sufficiently directly related to communication or collaboration, but developing an R package and sharing it with others requires communication (writing the documentation) and is a great way to contribute to the collaborative and supportive R community. If you are not sure, please ask!

You will use the SMART goals framework (see image below) when setting out your proposal. The more thought you put into this upfront, the easier collecting evidence and reflecting on your progress will be at the end. More information will be available on the respective assessment pages when they go live.

### Checklist

Before submitting your proposal, check the following:

-   Your goal is specific. **(Specific)**

-   At least one resource you will use to help you is identified. **(Specific)**

-   It is clear how you will define success.**(Measurable)**

-   It is clear how you will measure your progress. **(Measurable)**

-   Your goal has an appropriate scope and is attainable. **(Attainable)**

    -   This is shown through a description of the steps you'll need to take and what potential problems you might face. Related to timeline below.

-   The goal is related to communication and/or collaboration appropriate for a statistician/data-related role. **(Relevant)**

-   It is clear why this goal is relevant to you personally. **(Relevant)**

-   The steps you want to complete can be completed in 7 weeks. (**Attainable** and **Time-bounded**)

-   A timeline with dates/weeks for the required steps is included. **(Time-bounded)**

-   The timeline shows some accommodation for troubleshooting/delays. **(Time-bounded)**

-   There is a clear concluding sentence or sentences that wrap(s) up the proposal.

-   You have proofread your proposal and made sure the structure is logical and there are not intrusive grammatical or word choice errors.

-   You have written in full sentences.

-   Your final version is saved as a PDF.

### Things to keep in minds as you start working towards your professional development goal

-   Track your time

    -   A time sheet should be part of your evidence submission

-   Create a work log document or file to store screenshots in, make notes of tasks you've completed

    -   This will make writing your reflection much easier

### Example smart goal

Note: This is *not* a collaboration/communication goal, but provides some examples of how to approach a SMART goal. Where there are ellipses ("...") we are suggesting there would be more of the same, but this example should be enough to give you the idea. You should *not* use ellipses in this way in your own proposal.

#### Specific

Goal: *"Climb to the peak of Mount Robson over 2 weeks in January and write one blog post for my website about the journey."*

Bad example: "Climb a mountain and write about it." Which mountain? What type of writing and with what purpose?

Resources: *"I will need climbing equipment, my camera, notebook ... "*

#### Measurable

Defining success: "*Reach the peak of Mount Robson and return and write at least 1 blog entry with a picture about the journey, all in 2 weeks."*

Bad example: "Climbed Mount Robson." Needs more details about what this success looks like. Walk up a few metres and turn back? Relates to time-bounded also.

Measuring my progress: *"I will measure my progress by how many steps of my goals I have accomplished and the altitude of my climb relative to the elevation of Mount Robson (3,954 m). I will have taken a picture "*

#### Attainable

You have or can you learn the required skills: *"I am sufficiently fit to make this climb safely and have climbed a similar mountain recently. I have a camera and am currently taking an online course on blogging."*

Possible steps I need to take:

1.  *Arrive at Mount Robson Visitors Center with my climbing plan.*

2.  *Climb until ... on first day.*

*...*

6.  *Write one blog entry with one picture.*

Bad example: "Make progress with my goal by 7% each day." Not useful to you, what does 7% actually mean here? Will it really be the same amount of progress every day?

Potential problems:

1.  *Weather might be bad, and I may have to delay my climb by a few days.*

Bad example: "Something might not work." What? In what way? Could you solve it?

#### Relevant

Personal relevance: "*The climbing experience will help me learn new skills like ... which will help me work towards becoming a professional climbing guide."*

Bad example*: "Seems like fun."*

#### Time-bounded:

*"A 2-week journey from Jan 25th:Days 1-3to climb;Days4-6return;5 days for delays;3days to rest."*

### Reflection and evidence components

#### Activity, alignment and lessons

**Activity**: Describe what you did and what you learned. Be **specific** but you don't need a step-by-step guide or dates, save that for your timesheet. Assume your reader has *not* read your proposal and that you are introducing your goal and plan to them for the first time. (It may help to imagine how you might explain this task and your progress in a job interview.)

##### Examples

-   *I wrote 4 blog posts on .... The first one was on ... One unanticipated activity I had to do was ...*\
-   *This task helped me learn how to write for general audience...*\
-   *Through this task I improved my...*

**Alignment**: How well did your activity and progress align with your proposal?

##### Examples

-   *My plan changed as my goal was not specific enough. I think the reason for this is ... I can set realistic goals next time by ...*\
-   *Most of my attainable steps and potential problems were correctly identified because ....*\
-   *This is a good method which I will use again when I need to ...*\
-   *My way of measuring progress worked because ... This is useful for next time because ...*

**Lessons**: What did you learn from using the SMART goal-setting experience?

##### Examples

-   *An interesting thing I learned from the SMART goal-setting exercise was that ...*\
-   *I prefer to modify the format of SMART goals to match my work habits by ...*

#### Evidence

Provide links **and/or** copy/paste a screenshot of a blog, website, Github repository, Rmd document, ... Provide commentary on what the image/link is and what it demonstrates. I.e., Describe what we should be seeing and understanding from what you've included and how it relates to your goals.

##### Examples

-   *The screenshot shows ... which is evidence of partially completing [goal] ...*

-   *The provided link goes to ... which relates to [goal] ...*

-   *Notice that there are separate buttons on the website for each of the ...*

#### Timesheet

Include a timesheet that briefly describes how you used your time (no specific format required, but something like the below is fine). Hours spent can be approximate.

Describe what you learned from filling your timesheet. This can be short and could include how you'd track your time differently in future, what you noticed about your work habits from tracking your time

##### Examples

*About ...% of my time was spent preparing, maybe because the task was new. This means for future tasks that are new I need to consider ....*

*The timesheet can be better suited to my work habits if ...*
