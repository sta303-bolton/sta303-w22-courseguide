## Introductions

Hi folks,

Welcome to STA303! We're excited you're joining us on this statistical voyage. I look forward to introducing myself to you in our first class on Wednesday, but for now, there is are basic introductions below for me and our Head TA Amin. Feel free to skip to [How this course works](#howthiscourseworks), I know there is a lot to read in the module!

Looking forward to a great semester! See you in class on Wednesday.

**Pronouns:** she/her

Before moving (back) to Canada in 2019, I had lived more than half my life in New Zealand. (I still mention New Zealand a lot in class...) My current research areas are in statistics education and online learning, as well as health disparities across ethnic groups. I used to run a small consulting company and called myself a Data Ambassador. Why? Well, lots of people are consultants. I even did an internship in management consulting once upon a time. But it wasn't a satisfying title for what I wanted my work with people to look like. I wanted something that focused on the communication and interpersonal side, not just high quality and appropriate analysis. People who aren't confident in their ability to analyse their own data need a go-between, someone who can be an ambassador for their data! While I don't do consulting any more, I love helping students build their technical and professional skills so they can go out into the world and be excellent ambassadors for data themselves.

### Amin Banihashemi, Head TA

**Email:** [sta303\@utoronto.ca](mailto:sta303@utoronto.ca) (Amin will often be the one responding to your emails)

**Pronouns:** he/him

I'm a fourth-year PhD student at the Institute of Medical Science. I have been a TA for STA130 in DoSS for the past 3 years and this is my second semester as Head TA of STA303.

My area of research is clinical Neuroscience, something I am passionate about. I analyze images of brain and eye structures in neurodegenerative diseases. I investigate possible associations of these structures with each other and with the ability to remember well and carry out goal-oriented tasks successfully. I love creating reproducible statistical analysis workflows in R. I also like audiobooks, candlelight, and apple pie (which I make myself!)

## Hours expectations

While everyone has different work styles and learning needs, I want to provide some guidance around how I expect this course to look for students.

Plan to be doing 6--8 hours of work on STA303 each _week._ In a two-week module, this may be comprised of:

-   2--4 hours on videos and readings

-   1--3 hours of attending synchronous class or reviewing the recording and activities

-   1--2 hours on knowledge basket assessments

-   2--6 hours on other assessments

-   Remaining time attending reading announcements, office hours, checking Piazza, revision, etc.

### Module flow

### Communication

-   Our course discussion board on [Piazza](`r piazza`) is to be used for all content and administration questions. *Only* sensitive or personal issues/questions should be sent to [sta303\@utoronto.ca](mailto:sta303@utoronto.ca). We reserve the right not to respond to emails that should be Piazza posts.

    -   Please ensure all course-related emails include your **UTORID**. 

-   There are several important [forms](#forms) that you may need if you miss an assessment due to **illness or emergency** or wish to request a **regrade** of an assessment.

-   I will use Quercus [announcements](`r announcements`) to share course information and updates. **Please make sure you read these**. I may also occasionally email or Querucs message you about things that relate specifically to you.
