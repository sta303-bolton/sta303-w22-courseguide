# Knowledge basket: Writing and peer feedback

## General instructions {#writinggeneral}
The module writing and peer feedback activities have three stages.

-   **Create** phase due the first Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

-   **Assess** phase due the second Tuesday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

-   __Reflect__ phase due the second Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

### Create phase

The **Create** phase is due the first Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

-   Spend \~30 minutes writing a response to the prompt.

-   Write about 200--500 words. The word count isn't strict, but the submission requirements listed below ARE.

    -   The prompt should be clearly and comprehensively addressed.

    -   Your writing should be in full sentences and be broken into paragraphs as appropriate.

    -   Any grammatical or word choice errors should be minimal and not obstruct the meaning.

    -   There is a clear central idea that is well summarized in a concluding sentence(s).

    #### Submission requirements

    Your submission should be:

    -   typed (not handwritten)

    -   no more than one page

    -   single-spaced

    -   size 12 font

    -   margins should be no larger than 1 inch

    -   saved as a PDF

### Assess phase

The **Assess** phase is due the second Tuesday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

You will need to assess TWO of your peers in this phase. You will be asked:

-   if they have met the submission requirements,

-   to rate them on the rubric,

-   to make a short comment about a strength of this piece of writing,

-   to make a short comment about a way this piece of writing could be improved.

### Reflect phase

The **Reflect** phase is due second Friday of the module at 3:03 p.m. ET

-   Read the feedback received from your peers.

-   Rate the usefulness on a 3-point scale.

### General instructions

These assessments can be used to make up your knowledge basket. They are also useful in helping you prepare for your portfolio writing samples and final project writing.

Warning: MAKE SURE YOU CLICK SUBMIT! Check that each phase is showing as submitted. Students  have occasionally struggled with this in peerScholar's interface and no regrades/adjustments will be possible after the fact.

Your mark for this assessment will be based on participation. There will be separate marks for each phase, i.e., you can get part marks overall. 45% for completing create, 45% for completing assess, 10% for completing reflect. Please note that participation not in the spirit of the assessment (e.g. just putting the Lorem Ipsum text, or giving feedback like "write better" and nothing else) will not get you marks.

### M2 Instructions

Make sure you are familiar with the [general instructions](#writinggeneral) for these types of tasks.

#### M2 Prompt

Read [*Science isn't broken*(Aschwanden, 2015)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/) using the *previewing* and *skimming* strategy outlined below. Discuss what you learn from the article, with a focus on what you **notice마bout맟our own thinking**망hen맗laying with the *"Hack Your WayToScientific Glory*" interactive. Make sure you paraphrase appropriately (see [Module 2 paraphrasing section](#paraphrasing)) and add the reference for the article. (It is okay to put the reference by itself on a second page, if required.)

Instead of reading from beginning to end try ***previewing*** and then ***skimming*** to be faster:

1.  Read the **title**. Pay attention to the "Filed Under" and date of publication.

   游뱂*Why do you think we have assigned this reading to you?*

2.  Skip the text until the **interactive figure** called "*Hack Your Way To Scientific Glory*".

When you change political party in section 1, or other items in section 2, how does the p-value change in section 4 of the interactive figure?

   游뱂*What do you understand from this figure? What do you notice about your own thinking as you play with it?*

**Tip:** Reading one paragraph before and after a figure helps clarify the figure.

3.  Skip the text until the **figure** of the football field.

   游뱂 *What do you understand from this figure?*

4.  Skip the text until the **figure** called "*Same Data, Different Conclusions*".

   游뱂 *What do you understand from this figure?*

6.  Read the two **bolded quotes**: "*Science is great, but*..." and "*Human fallibilities*...".

7.  Read the **last paragraph** (often the concluding paragraph).

8.  Now write your **200--500-word reflection** on what you have learned.

    -   **Paraphrase!** That is, use your own words, don't copy/paste. Use the [paraphrasing how-to from the week 2 module](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/204826/pages/w2-paraphrasing "W2 Paraphrasing") to help you.

    -   Discuss what you noticed about your thinking while playing with the *Hack Your WayToScientific Glory*" interactive.

    -   Include a **conclusion** at the end.

    -   Use in-text **citation** as follows (Aschwanden, 2015) and put the reference at the end.

9. Go back and read the entire text to see if your understanding was correct.

### M3 instructions

Make sure you are familiar with the [general instructions](#writinggeneral) for these types of tasks.

#### M3 prompt

Write the methods section of parts of the case study from [Chapter 8 Case Study: Music Performance Anxiety (Roback & Legler, 2021)](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-multilevelintro.html#cs:music).

I strongly suggest that you use **RMarkdown** for your writing in preparation for your final project. Knit and submit as a **PDF**. (You won't lose marks for doing it in Word, but if you're not comfortable in RMarkdown yet, I'd really recommend working on that! [Guide to writing LaTex equations in Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8).)

Write a short methods section that covers the final model from section 8.10.

-   Add a reference to the version of R this analysis was conducted with AND a reference to the package used.

    -   Recommend including a statement like the following: "*We fit a linear mixed model in R version 4.0.5 (R Core Team, 2021) using the **lme4** package (Bates, Maechker, Bolker, & Walker, 2015).* " (For this writing, it is okay to copy this exactly or modify is slightly.

        -   You can find the version of R you are using by running `version` into your console.

        -   You can get the appropriate R citation running `citation()` and `citation("lme4")` in your browser as well.

-   Include the the **model,** written out in LaTeX.

    -   In the current reading it is written as a series of equations. You should rewrite it to be a single **composite** equation, like the way we have been writing them in class.

    -   **Explain each model term below the model**; paraphrase (do not just copy/paste) from the book.

-   DO NOT plagiarize Roback and Legler (2021) or the original article (Sadler & Christopehr, 2010). Use your own words. You will be writing something shorter, anyway.

-   Write it as if *you were* one of the authors of the study (you can use 'we').

-   Include all of the methods components you can from the list below ('Methods components'). Section 8.2 will be especially helpful with this.

    -   You also can access the original research article through the U of T library, if you wish.

        -   Need help navigating library resources? Reach out to the Head Librarian at the Mathematical Sciences Library, Bruce Garrod. You can find his contact details in the Library Resources tab of the Course Navigation menu.

-   Place these **references** at the end (can be on a ***second*** page IF required):

    -   Roback, P., & Legler, J. (2021). 8 Introduction to Multilevel Models. In Beyond Multiple Linear Regression: Applied Generalized Linear Models and Multilevel Models in R. Retreived from <https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-multilevelintro.html>. Boca Raton: CRC Press.

    -   Sadler, Michael E., and Christopher J. Miller. 2010. "Performance Anxiety: A Longitudinal Study of the Roles of Personality and Experience in Musicians." *Social Psychological and Personality Science* 1 (3): 280--87. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1948550610370492>.

    -   Get the citation for R with `citation()` and include it.

    -   Get the citation for **lme4** with `citation("lme4")` and include it.

-   You may wish to use phrases from the [Methods section of the Manchester Academic Phrase bank](https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/describing-methods/) to help you describe your methods.

The methods section is usually written in **past tense** and often in the **passive voice** (Swales & Feak, 2012), though there is LOTS of discussion in academia about the use of passive vs active voice. We are not going to require you to write one way or the other for this---consistency is the key thing to aim for.

##### Example from a *different* article: Modified from (Berlowitz et al., 2017):                                                                                                                                (1) We conducted a study to compare the effect of two strategies to control blood pressure on physical health: an experimental intensive treatment and the standard treatment currently in use. After recruitment, participants were randomly allocated (randomization) to either the intensive treatment or the standard treatment. (2) The study involved recruitment from 102 clinical sites from November 2010 to March 2013. (3) A total of 9,361 participants 50 years of age or older who had evidence of hypertension were included, but those with diabetes or prior stroke were excluded. (4) The source of the data is the SPRINT study. Physical health was measured using a questionnaire with scores ranging from 0 to 100, with greater scores meaning better physical health. Data were collected at baseline and follow up. 

(5a) To compare longitudinal change for physical health between the treatment groups, "we estimated a linear mixed model assuming linear mean change over time within each treatment group." (5b) "The model for 洧녧~洧녰洧녱~ (*j^th^*physical health measurement for *i^th^* participant measured at time *t~ij~* (in years)) is as follows:     

洧녧~洧녰洧녱~= 洧띻0 +洧띻~1~洧냪洧녵洧노洧뉧롐洧멇롐뒳롐洧~洧녰~ + 洧띻~2~洧노~洧녰洧녱~ + 洧띻~3~洧냪洧녵洧노洧뉧롐洧멇롐뒳롐洧~洧녰~洧노~洧녰洧녱~+ 洧녪~1洧녰~ + 洧녪~2洧녫洧녰~ + 洧~洧녰洧녱~                                                                                                                                                                                  (5c) Where 洧냪洧녵洧노洧뉧롐洧멇롐뒳롐洧~洧녰~ is the randomization assignment for the *i^th^* participant (1=Intensive-treatment; 0=Standard-treatment), 洧녫~洧녰~ denotes the clinic site for the *i^th^* participant (participants were randomized at 102 clinic sites), 洧녪~1洧녰~ is a subject-specific random effect, 洧녪~2,洧녫洧녰~ is a clinic-specific random effect, and 洧~洧녰洧녱~ denotes the residual error component."                                                                                             

"The models included participant-specific and clinic-specific random effects to address within-participant correlations as a result of repeated assessments and correlations among participants at the same [study] site. Fixed effects in the model included treatment group, follow-up time, and the interaction between the treatment group and follow-up time."
